<h2>What do I need to run TPS or ETPS?</h2>

<p>
ETPS is a subsystem of TPS and is distributed with TPS.
</p><p>
TPS has been used extensively under Unix and Linux systems,
and to some extent under Windows and Mac OS X.
Instructions for installing TPS
are distributed with TPS as README.unix, README.gnuclisp,
and README.windows.txt text files.
The instructions for Windows installation
have been developed for WINDOWS 98 and ME (2000)
and may not apply to other versions of Windows.         
</p><p>
You'll need a Common Lisp compiler. 
We've used Allegro CL, CMU Common Lisp (CMUCL); Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL),
GNU CLISP, Kyoto CL, Lucid CL, Ibuki CL, DEC-20 CL and Austin Kyoto CL.
A few features of TPS (but nothing essential) will work only if you have XWindows.
 After you have the files, you will need to compile
them using the Common Lisp available on your own system.  Instructions
for compiling the files are included in the <A HREF="tps-mans.html">documentation</A>, which is
included in several postscript files in the system distribution.
</p><p>
The entire system comes as a single gzipped tar file,
almost 9Mb long. The unzipped tar file is about 35 Mb long.
The compiled core image will be in the region of 
9-30Mb, depending on your compiler.
</p><p>


The release date and time of the current tar file is recorded <A HREF="RELEASEDATE">here</A>.
Release notes are <A HREF="whatsnew.html">here</A>.
