                  proving environment TPS [Andrews96] into the mathematical assistant
                  OMEGA [Omega97]. TPS can be called from OMEGA either as a black box or
                  as an interactive system. In black box mode, the user has control over
                  the parameters which control proof search in TPS; in interactive mode,
                  all features of the TPS-system are available to the user. If the
                  subproblem which is passed to TPS contains concepts defined in OMEGA's
                  database of mathematical theories, these definitions are not
                  instantiated but are also passed to TPS. Using a special theory which
                  contains proof tactics that model the ND-calculus variant of TPS within
                  OMEGA, any complete or partial proof generated in TPS can be translated
                  one to one into an OMEGA proof plan. Proof transformation is realised by
                  proof plan expansion in OMEGA's 3-dimensional proof data structure, and
                  remains transparent to the user.},

                  commands. Such mechanisms support the user by decreasing the necessary

                  the proof state, steadily computes suggestions on how to further
                  construct the proof, and communicates these suggestions to the user via
                  a graphical user interface. We furthermore introduce a focus technique
                  in order to restrict the search space when deriving default
                  suggestions. Although the agents we discuss in this paper are rather

                  adapting traditional first-order (FO) paramodulation~\cite{RoWo69} , and
                  a calculus $\EXTRUE$ adapting FO RUE-Resolution~\cite{Digricoli79} to HO
                  logic (based on Church's simply typed $\lambda$-calculus). $\EXTPARA$
                  and $\EXTRUE$ extend the extensional HO resolution approach
                  $\EXTRES$~\cite{BenKoh:ehor98}. In order to reach Henkin completeness
                  without the need for additional extensionality axioms both calculi
                  employ new, positive extensionality rules analogously to the respective
                  negative ones provided by $\EXTRES$ that operate on unification
                  constraints. As the extensionality rules have an intrinsic and
                  unavoidable difference-reducing character the HO paramodulation approach
                  looses its pure term-rewriting character. On the other hand examples
                  demonstrate that the extensionality rules harmonise rather well with the
                  difference-reducing HO RUE-resolution idea.}

                  run-time extendibility and resource adaptability. Moreover, it supports
                  the distributed integration of external reasoning systems. We also

                  applications often requires the help of mediator systems as middleware
                  components. In the domain of theorem proving large efforts have been
                  made to formalize knowledge for mathematics and verification issues, and
                  to structure it in databases. But these databases are either specialized
                  for a single client, or if the knowledge is stored in a general
                  database, the services this database can provide are usually limited and
                  hard to adjust for a particular theorem prover. Only recently there have
                  been initiatives to flexibly connect existing theorem proving systems
                  into networked environments that contain large knowledge bases. An
                  intermediate layer containing both, search and proving functionality can
                  be used to mediate between the two. In this paper we motivate the need
                  and discuss the requirements for mediators between mathematical
                  knowledge bases and theorem proving systems. We also present an attempt

  abstract =	 {Verification of hybrid systems is a challenging task. Unlike many other
                  verification methods the approach proposed in [nonnengart99] avoids
                  approximations and operates directly on the original system
                  specifications. This approach, however, requires the solution of
                  non-trivial mathematical subtasks. We propose to model those kinds of
                  subtasks that are suitable for being tackled with reasoning specialists
                  as mathematical service requests to a network of service systems like
                  the MathWeb Software Bus. So far we have identified the following
                  candidates of mathematical service requests: the solution of
                  differential equations, subsumption and consistency of sets of
                  constraints. A further candidate can be the elimination of second order
                  set variables with higher order theorem provers.},

                  logic with the purpose of clarifying the role of extensionality. To
                  reach this goal, we distinguish nine classes of higher order models with
                  respect to various combinations of Boolean extensionality and three
                  forms of functional extensionality. Furthermore, we develop a
                  methodology of abstract consistency methods (by providing the necessary
                  model existence theorems) needed to analyze completeness of
                  (machine-oriented) higher order calculi with respect to these model
                  classes.},

  abstract =	 {Research on automated and interactive theorem proving aims at the
                  mechanization of logical reasoning. Aside from the development of logic
                  calculi it became rapidly apparent that the organization of proof search
                  on top of the calculi is an essential task in the design of powerful
                  theorem proving systems. Different paradigms of how to organize proof
                  search have emerged in that area of research, the most prominent
                  representatives are generally described by the buzzwords: automated
                  theorem proving, tactical theorem proving and proof planning. Despite
                  their paradigmatic differences, all approaches share a common goal: to
                  find a proof for a given conjecture. In this paper we start with a
                  rational reconstruction of proof search paradigms in the area of proof
                  planning and tactical theorem proving. Guided by similarities between

                  that accommodates the various proof search methodologies and eases their

                  proving systems or proof planning systems for classical first-order
                  logic. Due to Huang the notion of assertion comprises mathematical
                  knowledge from a mathematical knowledge base KB such as definitions,
                  theorems, and axioms. %, as well as assumptions generated within the
                  prover during proof construction. We propose a distributed mediator
                  module between KB and a theorem proving system S which is independent of
                  the particular proof representation format of S and which applies
                  generalized resolution in order to analyze the logical consequences of
                  arbitrary assertions for a proof context at hand. Our approach is
                  applicable without any extension also to the assumptions that are
                  dynamically created during a proof search process. It therefore realizes
                  a crucial first step towards full automation of assertion level
                  reasoning. We discuss the benefits and connection of our approach to
                  proof planning and motivate an application in a project aiming at a
                  tutorial dialogue system for mathematics.},

                  mathematics. As soon as we ask ``why?'' we start proving. Proving is
                  cultivated reasoning. Mathematics cannot be defined by the objects
                  studied but only by its method, which is proving. Formal proving, the
                  basis of computer-supported proving, will drastically change the way we
                  do mathematics. Computing is a special case of proving, and proving is a
                  special case of computing. Actually, computing and proving are two of
                  the three main aspects of formal mathematical activity. The third aspect
                  is solving. Proving, solving, and computing naturally correspond to the
                  way free variables in formulae are considered: They can be universally
                  quantified, existentially quantified, or left free for substitution."
