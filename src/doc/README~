This directory and its subdirectories are the sources for TPS
documentation.  Each of the directories etps, grader, facilities, and
user contains the files for one of the manuals. (The facilities
directory actually contains the files for both the facilities manual
and the facilities-short manual.)

To print a manual on a postscript printer, just print the press file
manual.ps in the relevant directory.

Each directory also contains the Scribe or Latex manuscript files
which will produce a press file.  For example, to create a new press
file for the etps manual, do the following:
% cd etps
% scribe manual 

The file lib/ksets.lib contains the definitions of the fonts needed for
each printer.
