@chapter(Using @HETPS on Andrew)

@section(Starting @HETPS)

To begin @ETPS on Andrew, do the following:

@t(% /afs/andrew/mcs/math/etps/bin/etps)

You should begin @ETPS in a private directory, one in which
others cannot read the files you will be creating.

To make things easier, add the line@*
@t(source /afs/andrew/mcs/math/etps/etps.cshrc)@*
to your ~/.cshrc file.
This will set up aliases for you, so that the command@*
@t(etps)@*
 will start up @ETPS without you having to remember the exact path name.

@ETPS can be run on Unix-based Andrew workstations.
@comment[Sun workstations which may be found
in rooms of the Wean Hall 5200 corridor and the WestWing dorm cluster.]
You may also find that you can run it on other Unix-based
workstations which are scattered around various offices on campus.
If you wish to use a workstation on which @ETPS does not currently run, send
mail to pa01@@andrew to see if something can be worked out.
@begin[comment]
@ETPS can be run on these workstation types: 
@comment[Sun3,] Decstation 3100, Decstation 5000, SPARCstation 5
@comment[sun4_413], SPARC Ultra, @comment[which is sun4_55]
HP712 @comment[hp700_ux90].
@end[comment]


If you are not logged in on an Andrew workstation, you should do@*
klog <andrew userid> -c andrew.cmu.edu@*
so that ETPS will be able to write in the score file when you
execute the DONE command.

If you start up @ETPS in a typescript window, it probably won't
respond to your commands; try starting it up in an xterm window
instead.  (If you start it up with the @t[xetps] command mentioned
below, this will be done automatically for you.)

@section(Using the Unix Servers)

If you do not have direct access to a workstation on which @ETPS runs, you can
run @ETPS on one of the so-called "unix servers".  These machines are named
unix1, unix2, ... .  They are set up to allow multiple users and must
be reached by using the program telnet.

When you log in to a unix server, you will want to choose the one which
is least loaded.  To find out which one to use, log into any of them
with the userid @b(muptime), as follows:

@begin(verbatim)
% telnet unix1.andrew.cmu.edu
Trying...
Connected to UNIX1.ANDREW.CMU.EDU
Escape character is '^]'.

4.2 BSD UNIX (unix1.andrew.cmu.edu)

login: muptime
@end(verbatim)

Each of the machines will be listed, along with their current loads.
Choose the machine with the lowest load.
You will then have to open a new telnet connection to the machine
you select.

You can also issue the @t(muptime) command while logged in under your own
userid and get the same information.

If you select unix17 (for example), you should issue the command@*
@t(xhost unix17.andrew.cmu.edu)@*
on the workstation from which you are telneting (provided that it has 
X-windows) so that  it will permit unix17 to open a window on your screen
when you run @t(xetps) as described below.


@section(Using @HETPS under X11)

If you are running the X11 window system, you can run @ETPS in a window
with fonts that have special symbols for the logical connectives and
quantifiers, so that formulas will appear just as they do in the textbook.

If you sourced the file /afs/andrew/mcs/math/etps/etps.cshrc in your
~/.cshrc file, it will tell your X server where the fonts are.  If you
did not source it, you should place the line
@verbatim(/afs/andrew/mcs/math/etps/etps.Xclients) in your ~/.Xclients
file @comment[Next phrase has not been tested] or your ~/.xinitrc file
(if you are using one), or issue that command at the shell prompt once
the window system has started up.

If you are not logged in on an Andrew workstation and
the advice above about fonts does not work, just issue the command:@*
xset fp+ /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/mcs/math/etps/fonts/snfs/@*
or@*
/usr/misc/bin/xset fp+ /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/mcs/math/etps/fonts/snfs/

The file /afs/andrew/mcs/math/etps/etps.cshrc (which you should have
sourced in your ~/.cshrc file), has set up two aliases for using @ETPS
under X11.  The first is @t(xetps).  Just issue this at the shell prompt,
and a window will be started with @ETPS running inside.  Click with the
mouse to place the left corner of the window.

Once the window has appeared and @ETPS has started, you need to tell
@ETPS that you want to use the special fonts for output.  At the @ETPS
prompt, issue the command @t(<0> setflag style) then, at the
subsequent prompt @t(xterm).  If you have followed all the steps
above, the special symbols should appear when any wffs are printed by
@ETPS.

The second alias for running @ETPS under X11 is @t(xetps-big).  This uses
very large X fonts, and the window will take up most of your screen.

If you resize your @ETPS X-window and make it wider or narrower, you will
want to change the setting of the flag @t(rightmargin).  This is normally
set at 79 for 80 column output.  For example, if you change the window to be 
only 50 columns wide, issue the command @t(<1> setflag rightmargin),  then
enter @t(49) at the prompt.

Once you have started @ETPS, you will probably wish to use the
BEGIN-PRFW command to start up windows containing the current subproof
and the complete proof.  You will need to iconify the lower window or
move it up on your screen by the usual methods for manipulating
X-windows so that you will have room to issue @ETPS commands.

@begin[comment]
If you wish to start @t(xetps) from a workstation (such as an SCS workstation)
which is not an Andrew
workstation, you may be able to do so simply by executing the command:@*
xterm -geometry 80x54 -rw -fn vtsingle -fb vtsymbold -sb -n ETPS -T ETPS -e /afs/andrew/mcs/math/etps/bin/etps &


To start @t(xetps) from  an SCS DecStation 3100 (and perhaps also from
an SCS DecStation 5000), execute the command:@*
xterm -geometry 80x54+505+0 '#+723+0' -fn vtsingle -fb vtsymbold -sb -n ETPS -T ETPS -e  /afs/andrew/mcs/math/etps/bin/etps-from-cs &
@comment[ was /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/mcs/math/etps/pmax_cs/.etps.exe &]
@end[comment]

@section(Aborting a Command)

Respond to a prompt for an argument with @t(ABORT) to abort the current
command and return to the top level.  You can also use the control character
@t(CTRL-C) or @t(CTRL-G) (depending on what machine and version of LISP is
being used) to interrupt @ETPS and return to the top level.


@section(Stopping @HETPS)

To temporarily suspend @ETPS, use the control character @t(CTRL-Z).  Then
you can restart @ETPS with the @t(fg) Unix command.  Of course, if you
are running @ETPS in an X-window, you should not need to suspend it. You
can just make it into an icon.

To kill @ETPS, use the @t(EXIT) command from within @ETPS, or use
the Unix @t(kill) command from outside @ETPS.  
Warning:  it is possible to start
multiple versions of @ETPS and leave them hanging around.  
This is a bad idea, since those that
you are not using will be a drag on the system, slowing things down
considerably.

@section(Filenames)

In the Unix system, filenames are case sensitive.  When
you enter a filename in @ETPS, it will be translated to lower case
@i(unless you enclose the filename in double quotes).  For example, if
you answer @t(X2106.WoRK) when prompted for a filename, @ETPS will interpret
this as @t(x2106.work), but the entry @t("X2106.WoRK") will be interpreted
as @t(X2106.WoRK), just as you entered it. 

@comment[
In the Microvax version of @ETPS, you cannot use the "~user"
convention of referring to a user's home directory.
]

@section(Tex, Scribe and Printing)

The command @t(TEXPROOF) works just as described in the @ETPS manual.
Once you have created your ".tex" file on Andrew, however, you should just
start TeX by, for example,
@begin(verbatim)
% tex x2106
This is TeX, Version 3.1415 (C version 6.1)
(x2106.tex (/afs/andrew.cmu.edu/mcs/math/etps/sun4_55/doc/lib/tps.tex))
[1]
Output written on x2106.dvi (1 page, 1212 bytes).
Transcript written on x2106.log.
@end(verbatim)
This will produce the file x2106.dvi, and you can use the system command 
dvips to create x2106.ps from this:
@begin(verbatim)
dvips x2106 -o x2106.ps
@end(verbatim)
To print such a file, do the following, replacing @i(printer) with
the name of one of the Postscript printers such as birch, pine, etc.
@begin(verbatim)
% lpr -P@i(printer) x2106.ps
@end(verbatim)

You can look at the file after running tex but before printing it with the command
@begin(verbatim)
xdvi x2106
@end(verbatim)
Exit xdvi with the command "q".

To create output suitable for LaTeX
rather than TeX, set the flag @t(LATEX-EMULATION) to T while you are running @ETPS.

Alternatively, you can use the @t(SCRIBEPROOF) command in @ETPS to produce a file
such as x2106.mss, run it through scribe with the command "scribe x2106" to produce
the file x2106.ps. Scribe is not available on some machine types.

The default device for Andrew's Scribe is Postscript, and Scribe will
produce a file with the extension ".ps", e.g., "x2106.ps".

@section(Possible Problems)

Various @ETPS commands involve writing files.  These commands include
DONE, SAVEPROOF, and TEXPROOF.  Unfortunately, it quite often
happens that the fileservers which handle the directory in which you
wish to write are down.  This is especially common at night, when
the backing-up of AFS volumes is done.  When this happens, you will get
an error message saying something like "Clisp error trapped".  If this occurs,
try the following:

@begin(enumerate)
Try storing the file on your local workstation disk instead of AFS.
As an example, instead of @verbatim(texproof "x2106.tex") 
try @verbatim(texproof "/usr/tmp/x2106.tex").  

Later, after the 
fileservers are back up, you can copy the file to your home directory on AFS.

If the DONE command has failed, use SAVEPROOF to save your proof, then later
you can restore the proof and try the DONE command again.
@end(enumerate)
