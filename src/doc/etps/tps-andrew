You must be in the  pa01:tpsguest group to have access to TPS on andrew.

Source /afs/andrew/mcs/math/etps/tps/tps.cshrc in your ~/.cshrc file
on Andrew.  This will set up aliases for you, so that tps3 will start
up TPS without you having to remember the exact path name.
You can also use the aliases xtps3 and xtps3-big.

 You may need to follow the instructions in
http://gtps.math.cmu.edu/etps-andrew.ps to get the fonts set up
so that you can use xtps3 and xtps3-big.

Manuals are available at
