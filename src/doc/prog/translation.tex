\section{Cut-free Extensional Sequent Derivations to Extensional Expansion Proofs}

There is an implementation of the extensional sequent calculus
in Chad E. Brown's thesis (cf.~\cite{Brown2004a}) in \TPS.
The structure {\indexother{ext-seq}} defined in \indexfile{ext-exp-dag-macros.lisp}
represents sequent derivations in this extensional sequent calculus.
Sequent derivations can be created, manipulated, saved and restored in 
the \indexother{EXT-SEQ} top level.  If a sequent derivation is cut-free,
then the command \indexcommand{CUTFREE-TO-EDAG} (implemented in \indexfile{ext-seq-top.lisp})
will translate the sequent derivation to an extensional expansion proof.
The proof that this translation works is in Chapter 7 Section 10 of Chad E. Brown's thesis (cf.~\cite{Brown2004a}).

\section{Extensional Expansion Proofs to NProofs}

\TPS can translate an extensional expansion proof to a natural deduction proof
using the code in the file \indexfile{ext-exp-dags-nd.lisp}.
This code is automatically called when either of the extensional search procedures
\indexother{MS04-2} or \indexother{MS03-7} successful find a proof.  The translation code can also be explicitly
called from the \indexother{EXT-MATE} top level using the command \indexcommand{ETREE-NAT}.

There is an algorithm described in Chapter 7 Section 9 of Chad E. Brown's thesis (cf.~\cite{Brown2004a})
which translates extensional expansion proofs to extensional sequent derivations.
This algorithm is not implemented as part of \TPS, but the same ideas are used for
the algorithm translating from extensional expansion proofs to natural deduction proofs.
