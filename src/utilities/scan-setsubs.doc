The file scan-setsubs contains functions
for finding setsubs in natural deduction proofs.

Call scan-setsubs with a list of proof files.
For example, scan-setsubs can be called with
a list of strings where each string is the name 
of a .prf file in the proofs/complete directory.  

Scan-setsubs prints which proofs have setsubs,
which lines use the setsub, and prints the setsub.
It also returns a list of elements of the form
(<proof-file:string> <proof-name:symbol> <gwff-name-or-nil:symbol or nil> <setsub-info-list>)
where <setsub-info-list> is a list of elements of the form
(<line:nat> <setsub:gwff>).

Example:

<0>(load "/afs/andrew/mcs/math/TPS/utilities/scan-setsubs")
; Loading /afs/andrew/mcs/math/TPS/utilities/scan-setsubs.lisp
T

<1>(setq result (scan-setsubs (list "church-rosser" "imv-sol" "x2134")))
Proof CRTHM restored.
Proof CRTHM in file church-rosser uses setsubs:
Line 6 uses setsub LAMBDA M(T) LAMBDA N(T) EXISTS Z(T).RTCL R(OTT) M Z AND RTCL R N Z

Proof IMV-SOL-12 restored.
Proof IMV-SOL-12 in file imv-sol uses setsubs:
Line 11 uses setsub LAMBDA z(I).~LESS(OII) b(I) z AND ~LESS O(I).f(II) z

Proof X2134 restored.
(("imv-sol" IMV-SOL-12 NIL ((11 ((|z<I>| . LAMBDA) (AND NOT (LESS<OII> . |b<I>|) . |z<I>|) NOT (LESS<OII> . O<I>) |f<II>| . |z<I>|)))) ("church-rosser" CRTHM NIL ((6 ((M<T> . LAMBDA) (N<T> . LAMBDA) (Z<T> . EXISTS) (AND ((RTCL . R<OTT>) . M<T>) . Z<T>) ((RTCL . R<OTT>) . N<T>) . Z<T>)))))

          ;  Consider the first entry on the return value:

; "imv-sol"
; IMV-SOL-12 is the name of the proof (the value of dproof after calling (restoreproof "imv-sol"))
; NIL indicates that there was no gwff associated with the proof when the proof was saved,
;     if it were non-NIL, it would be a symbol which is the name of a gwff in the library.
; ((11 ((|z<I>| . LAMBDA) (AND NOT (LESS<OII> . |b<I>|) . |z<I>|) NOT (LESS<OII> . O<I>) |f<II>| . |z<I>|)))
; This indicates that line 11 uses the setsub "[LAMBDA z(I).~LESS(OII) b(I) z AND ~LESS O(I).f(II) z]"
