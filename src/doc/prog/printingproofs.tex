\section{Printing Proofs}

Proofs printed in Scribe or \TeX are preceded by preambles which are
defined by the variables \indexflag{SCRIBE-PREAMBLE} and 
\indexflag{VPFORM-TEX-PREAMBLE}. The values of these flags are set
in the {\it tps3.ini} file. Since these preambles source
files in the directory {\it .../doc/lib}, things must be done carefully to
make sure that \indexcommand{SCRIBEPROOF} and \indexcommand{TEXPROOF} 
will insert the appropriate pathname when tps is distributed to other 
locations. Note that the Makefile creates the file {\it tps3.sys}, which contains the variable
sys-dir which shows where the tps was built.
	
When the Scribe preamble was changed to add
\begin{verbatim}
@@LibraryFile(KSets)
@@LibraryFile(Mathematics10)
\end{verbatim}
some of the hacks in {\it tps.mss} may have become obsolete (but harmless).
Mathematics10 is a file from the standard Scribe library; KSets
is a file belonging to \tps.
