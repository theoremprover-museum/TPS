@Begin(Hand)
@GrComI(INSERT-GRADES) must be used every time you manually enter grades 
for a new assignment. If you later wish to change the grades on that
assignment, you should use @GrCom(MODIFY-GRADE).
@End(Hand)

@GrCom(INSERT-GRADES) first prompts you for the names of the new exercises.
Recall the warning in Section @ref(Precautions) about the names of
exercises et al. Also, you should use short names to improve the
legibility of your output. You can then use the @GrCom(ALIASES)
command to assign the real name to the short name. See Section
@ref(alias) for details.

Next, the type for each exercise must be given. There are two
pre-defined types, @t(LE) and @t(ET). @t(ET) is the type for the
computer-generated grades retrieved by @GrCom(ETPS-GRADE).
@t(LE) is for letter-grades, the only type of grades which 
@GrCom(CALCULATE-GRADE) (see Chapter @ref(calc)) treats 
as symbols rather than numbers.

Finally, you are asked for the grades. For each student in the class,
you will be prompted for that student's grades on the new exercises.
These grades may be entered as any @LISP expression. You will usually
give expressions such as: @t[98, 4.5, B+, D- or *]. (Standing alone,
* indicates that the exercise was not done; when * is the first element of a list,
it is the multiplication operator, e.g. @t[(* 2 3)] means @t(6)).

@GrComI(EXAM-GRADE) provides a convenient way to enter examination
grades. You will prompted for the name of the exam (with the prompt: @t(EXAM))
and the names of its problems (with the prompt @t(PROBS)), as well as
an output file. Then, for each student, you will be given a prompt with
the students name. You should respond with "Yes" (the default) if the student
took the exam. [Since @t(--MAX--) is treated as a student, you will need
to respond "Yes" to its prompt in order to enter the maximum scores for
the exam.] For each student that you claim took the exam, you will be prompted
for the score that student received on each problem. The totals are computed
and entered in the score file under the exam name given earlier. Also,
the output file, when run through @B(SCRIBE) and printed, will produce score
sheets (showing the score on each problem and the total grade on the exam)
for each student and a sheet showing the grades for the class.

@Section(Making the Output Convenient: ALIASES, COMMENT)@label(alias)

When you are printing the files from @GRADER, you may find
that complete exercise names take up too much space. Therefore, it
is convenient to refer to exercises by
one- or two- letter names, which we refer to as short names.
These, however, are not very mnemonic, so you may want to
keep a record of the actual names which the short names represent.

@Begin(Hand)
@GrComI(ALIASES) records the actual names corresponding

@Section(Automatic Grades: ETPS-GRADE, DUE-DATES)

@Hand[@GrComI(DUE-DATES) lets you assign due-dates before using the
@GrComI(ETPS-GRADE) command described below, so that information about
exercises completed late will automatically be recorded in the
@GrVar(grade-file). If due-dates have already been assigned, you can
change them with this command.  This command provides a convenient way
of keeping track of due-dates even if the @GrComI(ETPS-GRADE) command
will not be used.]
The date should be in the form 
@wt[@i{yy} @i{mm} @i{dd}], where @t[85 02 13] (for example)
means 1985 Feb 13.

@Begin(Hand)
@GrComI(ETPS-GRADE) collects grades from the record file, @GrVarI(etps-file),
generated by a teaching program.
@begin(comment) Following is totally wrong. Works only for ETPS done commands. DAN @end(comment)
@begin(comment)
 The data in this record file is expected
to be a column of parenthesized lists. Only lists whose second entry is
@t(DONE) are considered. For these lists, the first entry must be a
user-id, the third an exercise name and the penultimate a three-element list
indicating the date. (Other entries can encode any information you wish
to record; they will be ignored by @GrCom(ETPS-GRADE).)
The date-list is of the form @wt[@i{yy} @i{mm} @i{dd}],
e.g. @t[85 02 13] means 1985 Feb 13.
@end(comment)
The data in this record file is expected to be a column of parenthesized lists.
The format is as follows: the student's user-id is the first element of
the list; the exercise name is the second element; and the date completed
should be the fifth element of the list.  The date should be in the form of
a list such as @wt[(@i{yy} @i{mm} @i{dd})], e.g., @t[(85 02 13)]
means 1985 Feb 13.
@End(Hand)

As mentioned in Chapter @ref(setup), user-id's are required for all
students in the class. If a student does not have one or it is not
known, the dummy id @t(****) may be specified.

~r@GrCom(ETPS-GRADE) will prompt you for exercises and the grades
given for completing them on time.
For each list in the @GrVar(etps-file) showing a student completing
one of these exercises, @GrCom(ETPS-GRADE) gives that student 
the grade corresponding to that exercise. 
When @GrCom(ETPS-GRADE) is called at a later date, it will leave
previously recorded scores alone and insert scores for newly completed
exercises. @Grader remembers the exercises which @GrCom(ETPS-GRADE)
has earlier processed, so only new exercises need to be entered when you are
prompted for exercises. (If there are no new exercises, just reply
with a return.)

If the assignment was late, the exercise and the number of days
late are recorded. If no due-date can be found for an exercise,
you will be prompted for it. 

@Exempli[If the the @GrVar(etps-file) contains the following lists:]
@Begin(LispCode)
(bd79 diplo1 done 1 (85 05 02))
(ma24 diplo1 done 2 (85 05 08))
(jr03 diplo1 done 3 (85 05 08))
@end(LispCode)
then running @GrCom(ETPS-GRADE) 

@Begin(TPSExample)
<Gr7>etps-grade
Please enter a list of exercises and scores. e.g. (x6200 15)(X6201 20) : 
(diplo1 40)

[merging ...]
Please specify the due-date for DIPLO1: 85 05 08
@End(TPSExample)

produces the new record:

@Begin(TPSExample)
NAME                ID ESSAY1 DIPLO1 
--MAX--            NIL     60     40 
ARNOLD-MATTHEW    MA24     57     40 
CARLYLE-THOMAS    TC32     54      * 
DICKENS-CHARLES   CD51     53      * 
DISRAELI-BENJAMIN BD79     46     40  @^
GASKELL-ELIZABETH EG21     51      * 
RUSKIN-JOHN       JR03     52     40 @Gratia
@End(TPSExample)

If aliases for exercises are being used, the actual names may appear
in the @grvar(etps-file), but you should refer to the exercises by
their short names when calling @GrCom(ETPS-GRADE). Thus, you should
first call @GrCom(DUE-DATES) using the short names to get these names
into the @grvar(grade-file), then call @GrCom(ALIASES) so @Grader will
know which actual names in the @grvar(etps-file) correspond to which
short names, then call @GrCom(ETPS-GRADE). Be sure that @t{ET} grades 
have this type.

If you are using grader for several courses or sections of one course 
and you need to use @GrCom(ETPS-GRADE) for each of these,
exit @GRADER 
and start fresh for each section to avoid complications.


@Section(Updating the Class List: ADD-STUDENTS, @w(DELETE-STUDENT))

There are two commands for updating the class list in @GrVar(grade-file):

@Begin(Hand)
@GrComI(ADD-STUDENTS) prompts you for a list of student records.
Each student record is itself a parenthesized list where the first
element is the student's name, the second his user-id (if these are
used) and the subsequent elements are
his grades on the exercises to date, in chronological order. 
Be warned that grades past the latest exercise will be ignored. 
@GrCom(ADD-STUDENTS) will not introduce new exercises. 
If fewer grades are listed than exercises, the student will be  
given a grade of @t(*) on the later exercises.

@End(Hand)

@End(TPSExample)

@GrComI(DELETE-STUDENT) puts a record of students who have been
removed from the class list at the end of the @grvar(grade-file).


@Section(Generated Values: STATISTICS)@Label(Stats)

@GRADER automatically generates statistical data when the record
is updated. The statistical measures it updates are indicated by
the value of @GrVarI(statistical-options).
The default value for this variable is (@t{-sdev-} @t{-median-} @t{-mean-}), 
which stand for standard deviation, median and mean, respectively.

@Begin(Hand)
@GrComI(STATISTICS) forces the calculation of the statistical measures.
Normally this is done automatically, so this command is rarely needed.
@begin(comment)
As an example, if you wish to compute the statistics for ESSAY1, as well
as other items that were previously changed (DIPLO1 in this example)
proceed as follows:
@end(comment)
@End(Hand)

@begin(comment)
@Begin(TPSExample)
<Gr2>push 'essay1 listofchanges

(ESSAY1 DIPLO1)

<Gr3>statistics
@End(TPSExample)

@GrCom(STATISTICS) then computes all of the measures in 
@GrVar(statistical-options) for @t{ESSAY1}, as well as @t{DIPLO1}. 
@end(comment)

@section(Displaying Information: DISPLAY, @w(NUMBER-OF-STUDENTS), @w(INFO-EXERCISES))

@Begin(Hand)
@GrComI(DISPLAY) will show the grades for one or all of the students 
on the desired exercises.
If all the grades for a student are requested, the late exercises and 
their number of days late will also be shown.
The mean, standard deviation or median for an exercise may be found
by responding with @t(-mean-, -sdev- ) or @t( -median- ) when
prompted for a student name.
@End(Hand)

@Begin(Hand)
@GrComI(NUMBER-OF-STUDENTS) gives you the size of the class.
