		NEWDOC-CHECK

Copies of new documentation which has been installed
in the main manual but not yet checked by Andrews
should be put into the file newdoc-check
in the same directory. This will make it easy to see what
was added. Everything in this file should be completely
redundant. Its contents should be deleted as soon as
they have been checked.
