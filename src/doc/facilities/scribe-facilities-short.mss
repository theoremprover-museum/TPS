@ChapterPh(Top-Level Commands)
The internal name of this category is 
MEXPR.
A top-level command can be defined using DEFMEXPR.
Allowable properties are: @t{ARGTYPES}, @t{WFFARGTYPES}, @t{WFFOP-TYPELIST}, @t{ARGNAMES}, @t{ARGHELP}, @t{DEFAULTFNS}, @t{MAINFNS}, @t{ENTERFNS}, @t{CLOSEFNS}, @t{PRINT-COMMAND}, @t{DONT-RESTORE}, @t{MHELP}.

@Section(Top Levels)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexMexpr(BEGIN-PRFW)@\
Begin proofwindow top level.
Open Current Subproof, Current Subproof & Line Numbers, and Complete Proof
windows with text size determined by the value of the flag CHARSIZE.
Printing in various windows can be modified by changing the flags
PROOFW-ACTIVE, PROOFW-ALL, PROOFW-ACTIVE+NOS, BLANK-LINES-INSERTED 
and PRINTLINEFLAG.
The initial size of the windows can be modified with the flags
PROOFW-ALL-HEIGHT, PROOFW-ALL-WIDTH, PROOFW-ACTIVE-HEIGHT,
PROOFW-ACTIVE-WIDTH, PROOFW-ACTIVE+NOS-HEIGHT, and 
PROOFW-ACTIVE+NOS-WIDTH; after the windows are open, they can simply 
be resized as normal. PSTATUS will update the proofwindows manually
if necessary. 
Close the proofwindows with END-PRFW.

@IndexMexpr(DO-GRADES)@\
Invoke the grading package.

@IndexMexpr(ED) @i{edwff}@\
Enter the editor on a given wff.
Editor windows may be initialized, depending the values of the flags 
EDWIN-TOP, EDWIN-CURRENT, EDWIN-VPFORM. The flags BLANK-LINES-INSERTED and 
CHARSIZE determine the layout of these windows. The flags 
EDWIN-{CURRENT,TOP,VPFORM}-WIDTH and EDWIN-{CURRENT,TOP,VPFORM}-HEIGHT 
determine the intial size of these windows; they may be resized after they are
opened in the usual way.
WARNING: Since editing is non-destructive, nothing is done with the result
of the editing process!

@IndexMexpr(END-PRFW)@\
End proofwindow top level; close all open proofwindows.

@IndexMexpr(EXT-MATE)@\
Enter the EXT-MATE top level for building and manipulating
extensional expansion dags (see Chad E. Brown's thesis).

@IndexMexpr(EXT-SEQ)@\
Enter the EXT-SEQ top level for building and manipulating
extensional sequent derivations (see Chad E. Brown's thesis).

@IndexMexpr(HISTORY) @i{n} @i{reverse}@\
Show history list.  Shows the N most recent events; N defaults to 
the value of HISTORY-SIZE, showing entire history list. Values of N that 
are greater than HISTORY-SIZE have the same effect as the default value. 
REVERSE defaults to NO; if YES, most recent commands will be shown first.

@IndexMexpr(LIB)@\
Enter the library top-level.

See Also: UNIXLIB (an alternative library top level)

@IndexMexpr(MATE) @i{gwff} @i{deepen} @i{reinit} @i{window}@\
Begin an expansion proof for a gwff.

@IndexMexpr(MODELS)@\
Enter the MODELS top level for working with standard models
in which the base types (hence all types) are a power of 2.

@IndexMexpr(MTREE) @i{gwff} @i{deepen} @i{reset} @i{window}@\
Begin to enter the mating tree top level.

@IndexMexpr(POP)@\
Return from a top level started with PUSH.

@IndexMexpr(PUSH)@\
Start a new top level. This command is almost useless,
except from within a prompt (e.g. one can type PUSH in the middle 
of converting an etree to a ND proof interactively, call SCRIBEPROOF,
and then type POP to return to the conversion).

@IndexMexpr(REVIEW)@\
Enter REVIEW to examine and change flags or parameters.

@IndexMexpr(REWRITE) @i{p2} @i{p1} @i{a} @i{b} @i{p2-hyps} @i{p1-hyps}@\
Rewrite a line of the current natural deduction proof in the
REWRITING top level. When finished rewriting, use OK to leave the REWRITING top
level, modifying the main proof accordingly.

@IndexMexpr(REWRITE-IN) @i{theory} @i{p2} @i{p1} @i{a} @i{b} @i{p2-hyps} @i{p1-hyps}@\
Rewrite a line in the REWRITING top level using a particular
theory.

@IndexMexpr(REWRITING)@\
Enter the REWRITING top level.

@IndexMexpr(TEST) @i{gwff} @i{deepen} @i{reinit} @i{window}@\
Enter the test top level. In this top level, the user can search
for an optimal mode in which to prove a particular theorem, by defining
a list of flags to be varied and then running matingsearch repeatedly 
with different flag settings.
It only works if the value of the flag DEFAULT-MS is one of thse:
MS88, MS89, MS90-3, MS90-9, MS91-6, MS91-7, MS92-9, MS93-1, MS98-1, 
MS03-7 and MS04-2.

@IndexMexpr(UNIFORM-SEARCH) @i{gwff} @i{window} @i{mode} @i{slist} @i{modify}@\
Enter the test top level to search for any mode that will prove
a given theorem. The mode provided by the user should list flag settings
that are not to be varied, and the searchlist provided by the user should
list all of the flags to be varied. The default settings for the mode and
searchlist are UNIFORM-SEARCH-MODE and UNIFORM-SEARCH-2.
If you opt for the searchlist to be automatically modified, TPS will inspect
the given wff to check whether it is first order, whether it contains any 
definitions, whether it contains any equalities (and if so whether the LEIBNIZ
and ALL instantiations are different), and whether it has any possible primitive
substitutions, and will then remove or modify any unnecessary flags from the 
searchlist (respectively, unification bounds will be deleted, REWRITE-DEFNS will
be deleted, REWRITE-EQUALITIES will be deleted or modified, and DEFAULT-MS will
be changed to a search without option sets).
Also, if you opt for the searchlist to be modified and there is a proof of this
theorem in memory, AUTO-SUGGEST will be run and you will be asked whether to 
modify the searchlist using the results it provides.

After entering the test top level with this command, type GO ! to start 
searching for a successful mode.

@IndexMexpr(UNIFORM-SEARCH-L) @i{goal} @i{support} @i{line-range} @i{window} @i{mode} @i{slist} @i{modify}@\
Enter the test top level to search for any mode that will prove
a given lemma. (Compare DIY-L) The mode provided by the user should list flag 
settings that are not to be varied, and the searchlist provided by the user should
list all of the flags to be varied. The default settings for the mode and
searchlist are UNIFORM-SEARCH-MODE and UNIFORM-SEARCH-2.
If you opt for the searchlist to be automatically modified, TPS will inspect
the given wff to check whether it is first order, whether it contains any 
definitions, whether it contains any equalities (and if so whether the LEIBNIZ
and ALL instantiations are different), and whether it has any possible primitive
substitutions, and will then remove or modify any unnecessary flags from the 
searchlist (respectively, unification bounds will be deleted, REWRITE-DEFNS will
be deleted, REWRITE-EQUALITIES will be deleted or modified, and DEFAULT-MS will
be changed to a search without option sets).
After entering the test top level with this command, type GO ! to start 
searching for a successful mode.

@IndexMexpr(UNIFY)@\
Enter the unification top-level. The user can define disagreement sets
using the command ADD-DPAIR available in the unification top-level. If you
are entering from the MATE top level, the unification tree associated with 
the active-mating is passed on to the unification top-level.
Any changes made to this tree are destructive. Applicable only for
a higher-order unification problem. Uses MS88-style unification.

@IndexMexpr(UNIXLIB)@\
Enter the library top-level with a unix style interface.

The value of the flag CLASS-SCHEME determines what classification scheme
is used to determine the virtual directory structure.

If the flag UNIXLIB-SHOWPATH is T, the prompt will be
<<CLASSSCHEME>:<PATH TO CLASS><num>>

If the flag UNIXLIB-SHOWPATH is NIL, the prompt will be
<LIB:<CLASS><num>>

See Also: LIB, PSCHEMES, CLASS-SCHEME, UNIXLIB-SHOWPATH, CD, LS, PWD, LN, RM,
MKDIR, FETCH, SHOW@End(Description)

categories of TPS objects, commands, argument types, logical constants, etc.

@IndexMexpr(HELP) @i{keyword}@\
Give information about a TPS object like a command or argument type.
The amount of help given for inference rules may be changed by setting the
flag SHORT-HELP.

The amount of help given for inference rules may be changed by setting the
flag SHORT-HELP.

@IndexMexpr(HELP-GROUP) @i{keywords}@\
Give information about a group of TPS objects; specifically,
given the name of a category, a context, or a top level, 
list the help messages for every object in that class.
If given a list of names, it will list the help messages
for all the objects that fall into the intersection of these
classes (e.g. HELP-GROUP (MEXPR REWRITING) will show all the 
top-level commands in the context REWRITING).
NOTE: Remember that the name of a context is not necessarily
the name that prints on the screen; do HELP CONTEXT
to show their real names.

List all rules with their suggestion priority.

@IndexMexpr(LIST-RULES*)@\
List all rules with their intermediate rule definition help

@IndexMexpr(OOPS) @i{position} @i{replacement}@\

with another word. Positions start from 0, and the substituted-for
command will be entered into the command history list, so for example:
<9>HELP GR-FILENAMES
<10>OOPS 0 LIST      (calls LIST GR-FILENAMES instead)
<11>OOPS 1 GR-MISC   (calls LIST GR-MISC)

@IndexMexpr(PROBLEMS) @i{show-defns}@\
This command will list the names of all exercises available in ETPS.

@IndexMexpr(SEARCH) @i{phrase} @i{search-names}@\
Look for a key phrase in all help strings (or just all names) 
of TPS objects. See also KEY, in the review top level (where it searches 
through the flags) and the library top level (where it searches through
the library objects).@End(Description)

@Section(Collecting Help)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexMexpr(CHARDOC) @i{output-style} @i{styles} @i{filename}@\
List the special characters of certain output styles in a TeX or Scribe
file. The output file can be processed by TeX or Scribe and will have 
multicolumn format.

@IndexMexpr(COLLECT-HELP) @i{modules} @i{categories} @i{filename}@\
Collect help for the specified modules into a file. 
Prints out a # every time it finds a help message, and a * every time it 
finds a TPS object with no help message.

@IndexMexpr(HELP-LIST) @i{category} @i{filename}@\
List all help available for objects of the given category
into a file.

@IndexMexpr(HTML-DOC) @i{directory}@\

Load one of the function keys f1-f10 on a concept terminal with a string.

@IndexMexpr(RESET)@\
Put a Concept terminal into correct mode and load the function keys.@End(Description)

@Section(Starting and Finishing)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexMexpr(ALIAS) @i{name} @i{def}@\
Define an alias DEF for the symbol NAME.  Works just like the
alias command in the Unix csh.  If the value of NAME is *ALL*, all
aliases will be printed; if the value of DEF is the empty string, then
the current alias definition of NAME will be printed.  See UNALIAS.

@IndexMexpr(CLEANUP)@\
If the proof is complete, will delete unnecessary lines 
from a proof.  It may also eliminate or suggest eliminating
unnecessary hypotheses.
If the proof is incomplete, will do a partial cleanup in which
only unnecessary lines justified by SAME will be removed.

@IndexMexpr(SUMMARY)@\
Tells the user what exercises have been completed.

@IndexMexpr(UNALIAS) @i{name}@\
Remove an alias for the symbol NAME.  Like the Unix csh
unalias, except that NAME must exactly match the existing alias; no
filename completion is done.@End(Description)

@Section(Printing)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexMexpr(BUILD-PROOF-HIERARCHY)@\
This command builds hierarchical information into the proof outline.
The information includes associations between lines and linear chains
of inferences which trace the consequences of the most recent hypothesis
of a line.  That is, a line 

ln) Hn,m |- an

would be associated with a linear chain of lines l1,...,ln
where m is the line corresponding to the most recent hypothesis and
the proof would justify the modified lines

l1) H1,m |- l1
l2) H2,l1 |- l2
l3) H3,l2 |- l3  
. . .
ln) Hn,ln-1 |- ln

where H1 < H2 < . . . < Hn (subset relation). 

That is, we trace the consequences of the hypothesis m to the
consequence ln.  Such a linear chain is on one level of the hierarchy.
One level down on the hierarchy would be the linear chains associated
with each of the lines used to justify l1,...,ln (except those which
appear in the chain l1,...,ln).  If the proof is complete,
then lines l1 and m will be the same.

Lines without hypotheses are also associated with such
"linear chains", following the rule that l1 < l2 if
the proof justifies the inference l1 |- l2.

The resulting hierarchy information is used by PBRIEF, EXPLAIN,
and PRINT-PROOF-STRUCTURE to help users focus on the logical
structure of a proof.

@IndexMexpr(DEPTH) @i{num}@\
Causes all subformulas at depth greater than n to be printed as &.

@IndexMexpr(EXPLAIN) @i{line} @i{depth}@\
This command explains a line of a proof outline.
In particular, the command BUILD-PROOF-HIERARCHY builds
dependency information into a proof outline which allows
the proof outline to be viewed as a hierarchy of subproofs (see
help for BUILD-PROOF-HIERARCHY).  The command EXPLAIN shows
the lines included in the levels of this hierarchy (to the 
specified depth) starting at the level associated with the 
specified line.  Some flags which affect the printing include:
PRINT-COMBINED-UIS, PRINT-COMBINED-UGENS, PRINT-COMBINED-EGENS,
and PRINT-UNTIL-UI-OR-EGEN.

@IndexMexpr(FIND-LINE) @i{wff} @i{vars} @i{meta}@\
Find all lines matching a certain wff, up to
alphabetic change of bound variables and (possibly) 
alphabetic change of a given list of free variables.
Optionally, you can treat the remaining free variables
as matching any given term (as you might do if you were
asserting an axiom).
e.g. (suppose P is an abbreviation or constant):
FIND-LINE "P a" () NO       finds all lines that say "P a"
FIND-LINE "P a" ("a") NO    also finds "P x" and "P y"
FIND-LINE "P a" () YES      finds all the above, plus 
                              "P [COMPOSE f g]"
FIND-LINE "a x" ("x") YES   finds all lines of the form
                              "SOME-TERM some-var"

@IndexMexpr(PALL)@\
	Print all the lines in the current proof outline.

@IndexMexpr(PBRIEF) @i{depth}@\
This command prints a proof outline, hiding some lines.
In particular, the command BUILD-PROOF-HIERARCHY builds
dependency information into a proof outline which allows
the proof outline to be viewed as a hierarchy of subproofs (see
help for BUILD-PROOF-HIERARCHY).  The command PBRIEF shows
the lines included in the top levels of this hierarchy (to the 
specified depth). PBRIEF is essentially a call to the command EXPLAIN
with the last line of the proof outline as the LINE argument (see help 
for EXPLAIN).  Some flags which affect the printing include:
PRINT-COMBINED-UIS, PRINT-COMBINED-UGENS, PRINT-COMBINED-EGENS,
and PRINT-UNTIL-UI-OR-EGEN.

@IndexMexpr(PL) @i{num1} @i{num2}@\
	Print all proof lines in a given range.

@IndexMexpr(PL*) @i{print-ranges}@\
Print all proof lines in given ranges.

@IndexMexpr(PLINE) @i{line}@\
	Print a specified line.

@IndexMexpr(PPLAN) @i{pline}@\
	Print a planned line and all its supports.

@IndexMexpr(PRINT-PROOF-STRUCTURE)@\
This prints the structure of the proof outline.  The
structure is generated by BUILD-PROOF-HIERARCHY.  Linear chains
of line numbers are printed which indicate the logical chains of
inferences.  Each link in a linear chain is indicated by an
arrow (l1)->(l2) where l1 and l2 are line numbers.  If line l2
does not follow in a single step from l1 (i.e., by a single application 
of an inference rules), then PRINT-PROOF-STRUCTURE will also show the
linear chains of inference used to justify (l1)->(l2).  Some lines
(such as those without hypotheses and planned lines) are
exceptions.  These top level lines are sometimes printed alone 
(instead of in arrow notation).  This could be read TRUE->(l) 
to maintain consistent notation, but the notation (l) appears 
more readable in practice.

@IndexMexpr(PRW) @i{gwff}@\
Print real wff. Turns off special characters
(including FACE definitions), infix notation, and dot 
notation, and then prints the wff.

@IndexMexpr(PW) @i{gwff}@\
Print gwff.

@IndexMexpr(PWSCOPE) @i{gwff}@\
print gwff with all brackets restored.

@IndexMexpr(PWTYPES) @i{gwff}@\
Prints a wff showing types.

@IndexMexpr(SHOWNOTYPES)@\
Suppress the printing of types on all wffs.

@IndexMexpr(SHOWTYPES)@\
From now on show the types on all wffs.

@IndexMexpr(TABLEAU) @i{line}@\
Print the part of the proof which justifies the given line,
in a natural deduction tableau format.

@IndexMexpr(^P)@\
Print current plan-support pair in the proof.

@IndexMexpr(^PN)@\
Print current plan-support pair in the proof, as in ^P, but 
also print just the line numbers of the other lines in the proof.@End(Description)

@Section(Saving Work)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexMexpr(EXECUTE-FILE) @i{comfil} @i{execprint} @i{outfil} @i{stepping}@\
Execute commands from a SAVE-WORK file.
Call this from the main top level or the proofwindows top level of TPS.
Note that this will not save subsequent commands in the same file,
which distinguishes it from RESTORE-WORK.
In the cases where EXECUTE-FILE doesn't work, one can usually just 
load the .work file into an editor and then cut and paste it, whole, 
into the TPS window.
Single-stepping only works between commands on the main top level;
it will not stop at prompts which are internal to a command, nor between
commands on a different top level. To force a work-file to stop in
such a place, use the PAUSE command when creating the work file.
If you are single-stepping through a file, you can 
abort at any time by typing ^G<RETURN>.

@IndexMexpr(FINDPROOF) @i{name}@\
Searches your home directory and the directories listed in
SOURCE-PATH, looking for a proof whose name contains the given string.

@IndexMexpr(FINISH-SAVE)@\
Finishing saving work in a file.
The difference between STOP-SAVE and FINISH-SAVE is: 
the former is temporary because you can use RESUME-SAVE
to resume saving work into the same file; the latter closes 
the output stream, so you can not save work into the same 
file after executing it.

@IndexMexpr(PAUSE)@\
Force a work file to stop and query the user. PAUSE, like ABORT, is valid
both as a top-level command and as a response to a prompt; it prints the 
message "Press RETURN, or Ctrl-G RETURN to abort.", waits for such a response 
from the user, and then repeats the original prompt.
This command is of no use unless a work file is being created; see EXECUTE-FILE 
for more details.

@IndexMexpr(RESTORE-WORK) @i{comfil} @i{execprint} @i{outfil}@\
Execute commands from a SAVE-WORK file and continue
to save in that file. See EXECUTE-FILE for more information.

@IndexMexpr(RESTOREPROOF) @i{savefile}@\
Reads a natural deduction proof from a file created by SAVEPROOF
and makes it the current proof.  A security feature prevents the 
restoration of saved proofs which have been altered in any way.
Retrieve any definitions which are used in the proof and stored in the
library before restoring the proof. If you don't specify a directory,
it will first try your home directory and then all the directories 
listed in SOURCE-PATH.

@IndexMexpr(RESUME-SAVE)@\
Use this command to resume saving commands into the most recent
save-work file.  Unlike RESTORE-WORK, this command doesn't
execute commands from the file, but simply appends subsequent commands to
the file.  You can not use this command if you are already saving work.
Also, you may run into trouble if you forgot to save some commands. 

@IndexMexpr(SAVE-FLAGS-AND-WORK) @i{savefile}@\
Start saving commands in the specified file, first storing all
flag settings.

@IndexMexpr(SAVE-SUBPROOF) @i{savefile} @i{lines} @i{subname}@\
Saves part of the current natural deduction proof to 
the specified file in a form in which it can be restored.  
The line ranges specified will be increased to include all the
other lines on which the given lines depend. See the help 
message for LINE-RANGE to find out what a line-range should 
look like. An example list is: 1--10 15--23 28 34--35
Also creates a new proof in memory with the given name, and
makes that the current proof.
Use RESTOREPROOF to restore the proof.
Overwrites the file if it already exists.

@IndexMexpr(SAVE-WORK) @i{savefile}@\
Start saving commands in the specified file. These commands can be
executed subsequently by using EXECUTE-FILE or RESTORE-WORK. If you are 
creating a work file for a demonstration, and need it to pause at certain
points as it is reloaded by TPS, then see the help message for EXECUTE-FILE
for more information on how to do this.

@IndexMexpr(SAVEPROOF) @i{savefile}@\
Saves the current natural deduction proof to the specified file in
a form in which it can be restored.  Use RESTOREPROOF to restore the proof.
Overwrites the file if it already exists.

@IndexMexpr(SCRIPT) @i{scriptfile} @i{if-exists-append}@\
Saves a transcript of session to a file. If the current setting
of STYLE is SCRIBE or TEX, an appropriate header will be output to the 
script file (unless the file already exists).
**NOTE** If you start SCRIPT from a PUSHed top level, be sure to do 
UNSCRIPT before you POP that top level, or your transcript may be lost.
The same also applies to starting SCRIPT from subtoplevels such as MATE;
you can enter further subtoplevels like LIB and ED from the MATE top level,
and SCRIPT will carry on recording, but before leaving the MATE top level 
you should type UNSCRIPT or your work will be lost.

@IndexMexpr(STOP-SAVE)@\
Stop saving commands in a SAVE-WORK file.

@IndexMexpr(UNSCRIPT)@\
Closes the most recent file opened with the SCRIPT command.@End(Description)

@Section(Saving Wffs)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexMexpr(APPEND-WFF) @i{weak-label} @i{help-string} @i{filename}@\
Append a definition of a weak label to a file.  If the file does
not yet exist, it will be created. You may wish to use LIB instead.

@IndexMexpr(APPEND-WFFS) @i{weak-labels} @i{filename}@\
Append the definitions of a list of weak labels to a file.
If the file does not yet exist, it will be created. You may wish to use LIB
    instead.@End(Description)

@Section(Printing Proofs into Files)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexMexpr(PRINTPROOF) @i{filename}@\
Print the current proof into a file.

@IndexMexpr(SCRIBEPROOF) @i{filename} @i{timing}@\
Print the current proof into a MSS file.
After leaving TPS, run this .MSS file through Scribe and print the resulting
file.

@IndexMexpr(SETUP-SLIDE-STYLE)@\
Sets flags to produce slides in scribe style.

@IndexMexpr(SLIDEPROOF) @i{filename}@\
Print the current proof into a MSS file. Use this command to make
slides.  After leaving TPS, run this .MSS file through Scribe and print the 
resulting file.

@IndexMexpr(TEXPROOF) @i{filename} @i{timing}@\
Print the current proof into a tex file.
After leaving tps, run this .tex file through tex and print the resulting
file.

Many flags affect the output of texproof.
See: USE-INTERNAL-PRINT-MODE, TURNSTILE-INDENT-AUTO, TURNSTILE-INDENT,
LATEX-EMULATION, TEX-MIMIC-SCRIBE, PPWFFLAG, DISPLAYWFF, INFIX-NOTATION,
PAGELENGTH, PAGEWIDTH, TEX-BREAK-BEFORE-SYMBOLS, LOCALLEFTFLAG, SCOPE,
ALLSCOPEFLAG, USE-DOT, FIRST-ORDER-PRINT-MODE, FILLINEFLAG, ATOMVALFLAG.@End(Description)

@Section(Proof Outline)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexMexpr(CREATE-SUBPROOF) @i{lines} @i{subname}@\
Creates a new proof in memory from the given lines,
plus all the lines on which they depend, and makes that 
the current proof.

@IndexMexpr(LINE-COMMENT) @i{line} @i{comment}@\
Attach a comment to a given existing line.
The comment will be parsed for gwffs and line numbers
as follows: anything enclosed in # symbols is assumed to
be a gwff, and anything enclosed in $ symbols is assumed
to be the number of an existing line. Line numbers in 
comments will be updated as lines are moved around;
gwffs will be printed in the current STYLE.
Examples:
"1st copy of line $5$, instantiated with #COMPOSE#"
"2nd copy of line $5$, instantiated with ITERATE"
"3rd copy of line $5$, instantiated with #a OR b#"
(The first prints the definition of COMPOSE; the
second prints the word "ITERATE", and the third prints
the given gwff. If line 5 is subsequently renumbered, 
the line number will change in all these comments.)

@IndexMexpr(MERGE-PROOFS) @i{proof} @i{subproof}@\
Merges all of the lines of a subproof into the current 
proof. If EXPERTFLAG is NIL, no line number may occur in both proofs.
If EXPERTFLAG is T, then if a line number occurs in both proofs, the

@IndexMexpr(PROOF-COMMENT) @i{comment}@\
Attaches a comment to the current proof.
The default value is the current comment. Uses the same
comment syntax as LINE-COMMENT; see the help message of that command
for more information. You can see the comments on all the 
current proofs by using PROOFLIST.

@IndexMexpr(PROOFLIST)@\
Print a list of all proofs or partial proofs currently in memory.
Also prints the final line of each proof and the comment, if
any, attached to it.

@IndexMexpr(TRANSFER-LINES) @i{proof} @i{subproof} @i{lines}@\
Copies all of the given lines of a subproof, and
all lines on which they depend, into the current proof. 
If EXPERTFLAG is NIL, no line number may occur in both proofs.
If EXPERTFLAG is T, then if a line number occurs in both proofs, the 
lines to which they refer must be the same (with one exception: if 
one is a planned line and the other is the same line with a 
justification, then the justified line will overwrite the planned one).
Different comments from two otherwise identical lines will be 
concatenated to form the comment in the resulting proof.

This is equivalent to CREATE-SUBPROOF followed by MERGE-PROOFS.

@IndexMexpr(ETREE-NAT) @i{prefix} @i{num} @i{tac} @i{mode}@\
Translates the current expansion proof, which is value of internal
variable current-eproof, into a natural deduction style proof. The default
value of the tactic is given by the flag DEFAULT-TACTIC.

@IndexMexpr(NAT-ETREE) @i{prefix}@\
Translates a natural deduction proof, (which must be the current dproof
-- use RECONSIDER to return to an old proof in memory), into an 
expansion proof. This will not work on all proofs: in particular,
proofs containing ASSERT of anything but REFL= and SYM=, proofs 
using rewrite rules and proofs containing SUBST= or SUB= cannot be
translated at present.  

There are several versions of nat-etree.  Set the flag
NAT-ETREE-VERSION to determine which version to use.

In all but the OLD version, the user is given the option of
removing lines justified by SUBST=, SUB=, or SYM= and replacing the justification
with a subproof.  This permanently modifies the proof.  (AUTO-SUGGEST
also gives such an option.)

@IndexMexpr(NORMALIZE-PROOF) @i{prefix}@\
Normalize a natural deduction proof.  The actual procedure
uses DEASSERT-LEMMAS to combine asserted lemmas into one big natural
deduction proof.  This is the converted into a sequent calculus
derivations with cuts.  A cut elimination (which may not terminate
in principle) creates a cut-free proof which is translated back
to a normal natural deduction proof.

the current flag settings except USE-RULEP is set to NIL.
BASIC-PROP-TAC is used to translate to natural deduction.

This command also eliminates other 'fancy' propositional justifications:
Assoc (Assoc-Left), EquivConj (in favor of EquivImplics),
Imp-Disj-L, Imp-Disj-R, Imp-Disj, Disj-Imp-L, Disj-Imp-R, and Disj-Imp.

@IndexMexpr(MAKE-ASSERT-A-HYP) @i{l}@\
Take a line justified by Assert, change its justification to Hyp,
make lines after it include this as a hypothesis, and perform a 
Deduct at the end so that the new proof does not depend on the Assert.

We may want to use this before calling nat-etree, since this does
not handle most Asserts.

@IndexMexpr(QLOAD) @i{filespec}@\
Load the most recent compiled or uncompiled file from your default

are used to determine whether compiled or uncompiled file should be load in:
(1) If the file name with extension '.lisp', always load the uncompiled source code.
(2) If the file name without extension, then
    (2.1) if both compiled and uncompiled file exist, and 
          (2.1.1) the compiled one is newer, it is loaded in.
          (2.1.2) the uncompiled one is newer, 
                  (2.1.2.1) if the flag 'expertflag' is NIL, always load the uncompiled 
                            source code.
                  (2.1.2.2) if the flag 'expertflag' is T, ask user whether load the uncompiled
                            one, or compile it and load the compiled one then.
    (2.2) if only the compiled one exists, load it in.
    (2.3) if only the uncompiled one exists, do the same as case (2.1.2)

for a class to use ETPS online.

See Also: USER-PASSWD-FILE

@IndexMexpr(SYS-LOAD) @i{modulelist}@\
Load all the modules in the given list, whether they
are loaded already or not.

@IndexMexpr(TEST-INIT)@\
Initialize the flag TEST-THEOREMS to test a collection
of theorems on a collection of modes.  This command should be
followed by TPS-TEST which actually tries to prove the theorems
with the modes.

There are currently several possibilities:

1.  Set TEST-THEOREMS to test a given set of theorems on
a given set of modes.  The default set of modes is determined
by the value of the flag GOODMODES.

2.  Set TEST-THEOREMS to test the set of modes given by the flag
GOODMODES on theorems that have a bestmode in the library
(determined by DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR) but are not 
known to be provable by some mode in the GOODMODES list.

3.  Set TEST-THEOREMS to test a set of modes given by the flag
GOODMODES on all the theorems the modes are supposed to prove.
(This tests whether a list of GOODMODES is still complete 
with respect to the corresponding list of theorems.)

4. Set TEST-THEOREMS to test all of the best
modes known to the library on all the theorems listed with
the best modes. By default, this will choose the first
mode listed for each theorem in the bestmodes.rec file; if you
choose to use multiple modes then it will test each theorem
with all of the modes listed for it in that file.  The examples
are listed in order from quickest to longest.
(This checks that all the theorems associated with bestmodes 
can still be proven by these bestmodes.)

@IndexMexpr(TLIST) @i{symbol}@\
Use a help function to display all of the property list of a symbol.

@IndexMexpr(TLOAD) @i{filespec}@\
Load the most recent compiled or uncompiled file from your default
directory, home directory, or source-path. In general, the following rules are
used to determine whether compiled or uncompiled file should be load in:
(1) If both compiled and uncompiled file exist, and 
    (1.1) the compiled one is newer, it is loaded in.
    (1.2) the uncompiled one is newer, then
          (1.2.1) if the global variable core::*allow-compile-source* is T, the
                  name of the file contains extension 

@IndexMexpr(TPS-TEST) @i{stop-on-success} @i{mate-only} @i{record} @i{moderec} @i{quiet-run} @i{expu} @i{newcore} @i{modify} @i{output} @i{timing} @i{testwin}@\
Attempt to prove a list of theorems.

The list of theorems, with the modes to be used, is stored as (theorem . mode) 
pairs in the flag TEST-THEOREMS. These theorems and modes will be fetched from
the library, if they cannot be found in TPS and if you have a library. You 
should set DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR appropriately. You can only do
DATEREC after each theorem if you have a library you can write to. 

The first argument STOP-ON-SUCCESS decides whether TPS-TEST should stop
trying to prove a particular theorem with different modes after one
mode has succeeded.  If this is T, then after TPS-TEST proves THM with MODE1,
where (THM . MODE1) is on TEST-INIT, TPS-TEST will not try to prove (THM . MODE2)
for any (THM . MODE2) on TEST-INIT.  It will however, continue to try to prove
other theorems on TEST-INIT with different modes (if there are any).

Quiet running uses the mode QUIET to switch off as much screen output as possible.

You can EXPUNGE between proofs (this will reduce the amount of memory
required, but will mean that other expansion proofs in the memory may
be lost; it will also re-assert your default flag values between each
proof).  Expunging does not really recover all the space used by TPS,
so many repeated proof attempts will result in running out of memory.
To remedy this situation, TPS-TEST can start a new core image for each
proof attempt.  In this case, each core image will start with a fresh
memory.  (When this option is chosen, expunging is irrelevant.)
Certain operating systems and versions of Lisp may not support
this option.

If TPS-TEST is running a new core image for each proof attempt, the
user can interrupt the slave core image using Control-C.  This should
throw one to the debugger level of the slave image.  In Allegro Lisp,
:res will cause the slave to die and throw the user to the debugger
level of the master core image.  Another :res will return the user to
the TPS top level of the master core image.

If the argument MODIFY is T, then the flag TEST-MODIFY can be 
used to change flag settings after loading each mode but before
searching.  See the help message for TEST-MODIFY for more information.

In versions of Common Lisp with multiprocessing (e.g., Allegro 5.0 or
later), the user can specify a time limit for each proof attempt.  The
user can also ask TPS-TEST to iterate trying every (THM . MODE) on
TEST-THEOREMS, increasing the time limit by a factor on each
iteration.  A (THM . MODE) is only tried again with a longer time if
it timed out on the previous attempt.  When multiprocessing is not
available (or if the user specifies an INFINITE time limit), TPS will
search for a proof using a given mode as long as permitted by that
mode.

If TPS-TEST encounters a bug, it will go on to the next (THM . MODE) pair.

The output file is kept independently of DATEREC records, and consists of a record
for each (THM . MODE) pair stating that the theorem was proved at a certain
time using a certain mode, or that the proof terminated with proof lines still 
remaining or that tps encountered an error.  Timing information can also
be sent to the short file if necessary.

If the short file already exists, the old copy will be renamed by adding 
.bak to its name.

See the help messages for TEST-THEOREMS, TEST-INIT and TEST-MODIFY for more information.

@IndexMexpr(TPS-TEST2) @i{searchlist} @i{quiet-run} @i{expu} @i{output} @i{testwin}@\
Like TPS-TEST (see the help message for that command), but calls
the TEST top level and attempts to prove one theorem repeatedly with several
different values of some crucial flags, to see how the time taken will vary.

TEST-THEOREMS should contain a list of dotted pairs of theorems and modes 
in which they can be proven; the searchlist which is used should have at 
least one setting in which the theorem can be proven (otherwise tps-test2
will never finish that theorem).

The output file (by default, tps-test2-output.doc) will contain a summary of 
the results. If this file already exists, it will be renamed by adding .bak 
to its name.

Records details of a bug. Saves the current flag settings, the output
of the HISTORY command, all currently loaded library objects, the 
current proof, the date and time and any comments (the best idea 
is to copy any error messages in to the "comments" prompt). 
This setup can then be retrieved with BUG-RESTORE.
The details are saved as a MODE1, under the name that the user provides
(in a file of the same name) with the assertion and library objects in
other-attributes and other-remarks respectively, and the context set
to BUG. The file will be saved in an appropriate directory (see
USE-DEFAULT-BUG-DIR).@End(Description)

@IndexOther(RESTOREPROOF) @i{savefile}@\
Reads an extensional sequent derivation from a file created
by SAVEPROOF in the EXT-SEQ top level and makes it the current
derivation.  A security feature prevents the restoration of saved
proofs which have been altered in any way.  Retrieve any definitions
which are used in the proof and stored in the library before restoring
the proof. If you don't specify a directory, it will first try your
home directory and then all the directories listed in SOURCE-PATH.

@IndexOther(SAVEPROOF) @i{savefile}@\
Saves the current natural deduction proof to the specified file in
a form in which it can be restored.  Use RESTOREPROOF to restore the proof.
Overwrites the file if it already exists.

@IndexOther(SCRIBEPROOF) @i{filename} @i{timing}@\
Print the current proof into a MSS file.
After leaving TPS, run this .MSS file through Scribe and print the resulting
file.

@IndexOther(TEXPROOF) @i{filename} @i{timing}@\
Print the current proof into a tex file.
After leaving tps, run this .tex file through tex and print the resulting
file.

Many flags affect the output of texproof.

subterms of the appropriate type (except quantified variables) and applying
to them all functions of the appropriate type to get all possible new terms.
I.e., you can think of it as constructing the Herbrand universe one level

quantified formula is controlled by the flag UI-HERBRAND-LIMIT.

not become a support of any other goal than the current one, since it
is not known if it is yet admissible for others.  The original support
line will be dropped from the supports of the current goal, but

The internal name of this category is 
TACTICAL.
A tactical can be defined using DEFTACTICAL.
Allowable properties are: @t{DEFN}, @t{MHELP}.

@Section(Tactics)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(CALL)@\
(CALL command) will execute command as if it were entered at the
top level by the user.  CALL is used only for side effects, the goal is
always returned.

@IndexOther(COMPOSE)@\
(COMPOSE tac1 tac2 ... tacn) will apply its argument tactics
in order, composing their results until one of them fails.

@IndexOther(FAILTAC)@\
Tactical which always fails, returns its goal unchanged.

@IndexOther(IDTAC)@\
Tactical which always succeeds, returns its goal unchanged.

@IndexOther(IFTHEN)@\
(IFTHEN test tactic1 [tactic2]) will first evaluate test, which may
be either a tactical or (if user is an expert) an arbitrary LISP expression.
If test is a tactical and does not fail, or is a LISP expression which does
not evaluate to nil, then tactic1 will be executed and IFTHEN will return its
results.  If test fails or is nil, then tactic2  (if present) will be executed
and its results returned by IFTHEN.  Tactic2 is optional; if not specified,
and test fails, IFTHEN will return failure.

@IndexOther(NO-GOAL)@\
(NO-GOAL) succeeds iff the goal with which it is invoked is nil.

@IndexOther(ORELSE)@\
Given a list of tactics, ORELSE will apply the first one which succeeds.

@IndexOther(REPEAT)@\
(REPEAT tactic) will apply tactic repeatedly until it fails on
every subgoal which has been created.

@IndexOther(SEQUENCE)@\
(SEQUENCE TAC1 ... TACn) applies tactics TAC1, ..., TACn in order,
regardless of their success or failure. 

@IndexOther(THEN)@\
(THEN tactic1 tactic2) will first apply tactic1; if it fails
 then failure is returned, otherwise tactic2 is applied to each resulting
 goal.  If tactic2 fails on any of these goals, then failure is returned,
 otherwise the new goals obtained from the calls to tactic2 are returned.

@IndexOther(THEN*)@\
(THEN* tactic1 tactic2) will first apply tactic1; if it fails
 then failure is returned, otherwise tactic2 is applied to each resulting
 goal.  If tactic2 fails on any of these goals, then the new goals obtained
 as a result of applying tactic1 are returned, otherwise the new goals
 obtained as the result of applying both tactic1 and tactic2 are returned.

@IndexOther(THEN**)@\
(THEN** tactic1 tactic2) will first apply tactic1 to the current
goal.  If it does not fail, tactic2 will be applied to the goals which are
produced by tactic1, and success will be returned along with any new goals
produced.  If tactic1 fails, failure will be returned.  Differs from THEN
and THEN* in that the current goal will never be copied.

@IndexOther(TRY)@\
(TRY tactic) will use tactic on the current object.  If any goals
remain after tactic finishes, then the original object will be restored,
otherwise the work done by tactic will be kept.@End(Description)

before exiting.@End(Description)

@Section(Printing)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(ETD)@\
Etree Display: print an expansion tree into list form,
printing shallow formulas for leaf nodes only. The format used is
NODE [selection and expansion terms] ; CHILDREN or SHALLOW FORMULA

@IndexOther(ETP)@\
Etree Print: print an expansion tree into list form, 
printing shallow formulas for all nodes. The format used is 
NODE [selection and expansion terms] ; CHILDREN ; SHALLOW FORMULA

@IndexOther(P)@\
Print the current node

@IndexOther(PDEEP)@\
Print the deep formula of an expansion tree.

@IndexOther(PP)@\
Print an expansion tree with node-names.

@IndexOther(PPDEEP)@\
Pretty-print the deep formula of an expansion tree.

@IndexOther(PPF)@\
Print the current proof.

@IndexOther(PPNODE)@\
Print an expansion tree with node-names.

@IndexOther(PSH)@\
Print the shallow formula of an expansion tree.

@IndexOther(PTREE) @i{gwff}@\
Print out the etree below the current topnode, showing expansion
variables, skolem terms, selection terms, and rewrite justifications.
Branches with *'s denote nodes that are being omitted for lack of space. The 
cure for this is to either start printing from a node lower in the tree, or 
make the screen wider, or use SHOWNOTYPES. See also PTREE*

@IndexOther(PTREE*) @i{gwff}@\
Print out the etree below the current topnode, showing expansion
variables, skolem terms, selection terms, and rewrite justifications. For
all other nodes, show the shallow formula at that node.
Branches with *'s denote nodes that are being omitted for lack of space. The 
cure for this is to either start printing from a node lower in the tree, or 
make the screen wider, or use SHOWNOTYPES. See also PTREE

@IndexOther(PTREE-FILE) @i{file} @i{width} @i{fmlas}@\
As for PTREE or PTREE*, but send the output to a file.
For a width of 200 characters, you can print the results using
some variant of the following:
"enscript -r -fCourier-Bold6 -dberyl <filename> "

@IndexOther(SHOW-OPTION-TREE)@\
Show the current option-tree.@End(Description)

@Section(Recording)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(O)@\
Invert PRINTMATEFLAG, that is switch automatic recording of mating-search
into a file either on or off. This has not actually been implemented!

@IndexOther(REM) @i{rm}@\
Write a remark into the PRINTMATEFILE.@End(Description)

@Section(Expansion Trees)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(DP)@\
Deepen a single leaf of an expansion tree.

@IndexOther(DP*)@\
Iteratively deepen an expansion tree until all leaves are
literals.

@IndexOther(DP=)@\
Deepen top level equality in the etree.

@IndexOther(DPTREE)@\
Deepen every leaf node of an expansion tree.

@IndexOther(DUP-ALL)@\
Duplicate all variables in an expansion tree.

@IndexOther(DUP-OUTER)@\
Duplicate all outermost variables in an expansion tree.

@IndexOther(DUP-VAR)@\
Duplicate a variable at an expansion node.

@IndexOther(EXP) @i{term}@\
EXPAND a given universal or existential quantifier.

@IndexOther(MOD-STATUS) @i{status}@\
Set the status of the current-topnode to the specified
value. If the status of a node is not positive, it is ignored during
mating search.

@IndexOther(NAME-PRIM)@\
If PRIMSUB-METHOD is something other than PR00,
NAME-PRIM lists all possible primitive substitutions for the current
shallow formula. See the flags PRIM-BDTYPES, MIN-PRIM-DEPTH, 
MAX-PRIM-DEPTH and PRIM-QUANTIFIER for information on how to change
which substitutions are generated.  One can use PRIM-SINGLE to
instantiate a set variable with one of the generated primsubs.

If PRIMSUB-METHOD is PR00, this creates a list of instantiated
etrees.  One can choose to do a mating search on one of these
using the mate operation SET-SEARCH-TREE.

@IndexOther(PRIM-ALL)@\
Apply primitive substitutions at all outermost expansion nodes.

@IndexOther(PRIM-OUTER)@\
Apply primitive substitutions at all outer expansion nodes.

@IndexOther(PRIM-SINGLE) @i{subst} @i{var}@\
Applies a single primsub. These can be generated by using
the NAME-PRIM command. The command PRIM-SINGLE destructively alters
the etree and creates a new jform, and is basically equivalent to
SUB-ETREE followed by DP* and CJFORM. The variable must be specified
in full detail, with both superscript and type, as in the vpform 
(e.g. "r^1(ob(ob))").

@IndexOther(PRIM-SUB)@\
Apply primitive substitutions at an expansion node.

@IndexOther(RESTORE-ETREE) @i{loadfile}@\
Loads an etree and makes this the current etree.

Example of how to use SAVE-ETREE for X2106 and later use RESTORE-ETREE:
<3>MATE x2106
<Mate4>GO
<Mate5>MERGE-TREE
<Mate6>SAVE-ETREE
SAVEFILE (FILESPEC): File in which to save the etree ["x2106.etr"]>
Later come back into TPS and do the following:
<0>MATE x2108 (or MATE whatever)
<Mate1>RESTORE-ETREE
LOADFILE (FILESPEC): File in which to load the etree ["x2108.etr"]>"x2106.etr"
<Mate2>GO
<Mate3>LEAVE
Merge the expansion tree? [Yes]>Y
Now ETREE-NAT should work.


@IndexOther(SAVE-ETREE) @i{savefile}@\
Converts the current etree to an internal representation and saves this to a file.
This currently only works for etrees generated with SKOLEM-DEFAULT nil.

Example of how to use SAVE-ETREE for X2106 and later use RESTORE-ETREE:
<3>MATE x2106
<Mate4>GO
<Mate5>MERGE-TREE
<Mate6>SAVE-ETREE
SAVEFILE (FILESPEC): File in which to save the etree ["x2106.etr"]>
Later come back into TPS and do the following:
<0>MATE x2108 (or MATE whatever)
<Mate1>RESTORE-ETREE
LOADFILE (FILESPEC): File in which to load the etree ["x2108.etr"]>"x2106.etr"
<Mate2>GO
<Mate3>LEAVE
Merge the expansion tree? [Yes]>Y
Now ETREE-NAT should work.


@IndexOther(SEL)@\
SELECT for a given universal or existential quantifier.

@IndexOther(SET-SEARCH-TREE) @i{etree}@\
Set the current etree to be a tree generated and named by NAME-PRIM
when PRIMSUB-METHOD is PR00.

@IndexOther(SUB) @i{gwff} @i{skolemize} @i{deepen}@\
Create an expansion tree from a gwff0.

@IndexOther(SUB-ETREE) @i{term} @i{var}@\
Substitute a term for a variable throughout an expansion tree. 
Destructively alters the expansion tree.

@IndexOther(TERMS)@\
Get the expansion terms of an expansion node or the
selected variable of a selection node.@End(Description)

@Section(Search Suggestions)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(ETR-INFO)@\

@Section(Mating search)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(ADD-EXT-LEMMAS)@\
Automatically add extensionality lemmas to the expansion tree.

See Also:  USE-EXT-LEMMAS

@IndexOther(GO)@\
Start mating search using default mating search (controlled
by flag DEFAULT-MS).

@IndexOther(NOOP)@\
Do nothing. (TPS uses this internally.)

@IndexOther(UNIFY)@\
Call unification in interactive mode for active mating. The unification
tree associated with the active-mating is passed on to the unification
top-level. Any changes made to this tree are destructive. Applicable only for
a higher-order unification problem. Uses MS88-style unification.@End(Description)

@Section(MS88 search procedure)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(ADD-CONN) @i{first} @i{second}@\
Add a connection to the current mating. TPS will not allow you to
add a connection to a mating if adding it causes the resulting mating to be
non unifiable. No check is made to determine if the connection spans
an open path.

@IndexOther(ADD-CONN*)@\
Repeatedly call ADD-CONN.

@IndexOther(APPLY-SUBSTS)@\
Apply substitutions found during mating search to JFORM. Applicable
only if mating is complete.

@IndexOther(COMPLETE-P)@\
Test whether current mating is complete. Will return a path that
is not spanned by the mating otherwise.

@IndexOther(INIT-MATING)@\
No further help available.  Sorry.

@IndexOther(MINIMAL-P)@\
A mating M is non-minimal if it contains some connection 
c such that M-{c} spans exactly the same vertical paths as M.
MINIMAL-P will find such a connection if it exists; otherwise
it will report that the mating is minimal.

@IndexOther(MS88)@\
Call mating search procedure on the current eproof.  This
procedure uses a naive level-saturation method, exhaustively searching
a single jform before applying any duplications. Quantifier duplications
are applied uniformly to outermost quantifiers. Will try primitive
substitution for outermost variable only.  Works on only a single
jform at a time.

@IndexOther(MS88-SUB) @i{etree}@\
Call MS88 on a partial expansion tree (subtree).

@IndexOther(REM-CONN) @i{first} @i{second}@\
Remove a connection from the current mating.

@IndexOther(REM-CONN*)@\
Repeatedly call REM-CONN.

@IndexOther(REM-LAST-CONN)@\
Remove the last connection to the current mating.

@IndexOther(SHOW-MATING)@\
Show the connections in the current mating.

@IndexOther(SHOW-SUBSTS)@\
Show the substitutions suggested by mating search for the complete
    active mating.@End(Description)

@Section(MS89 search procedure)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(MS89)@\
Begin mating search MS89 on the current expansion proof.
Primitive substitutions and duplications are performed systematically,
with multiple jforms being worked on simultaneously.  On each
particular jform, the search procedure MS88 is used.  The flags
MAX-SEARCH-LIMIT, SEARCH-TIME-LIMIT, and RANK-EPROOF-FN are used to
control the search.  See also the command SHOW-OPTION-TREE.@End(Description)

@Section(MS90-3 search procedure)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(EXPAND-ETREE)@\
Convert the jform proof found by path-focused duplication
procedures MS90-3 and MS90-9 into an expansion proof.

@IndexOther(MS90-3)@\
Start mating search procedure MS90-3 on current eproof.
This search procedure incorporates Issar's path-focused duplication,
but works on just one jform at a time.  Only duplications are done,
not primitive substitutions.  This is not an interactive procedure.

@IndexOther(PROP-MSEARCH)@\
Start Sunil's propositional mating search procedure.
This search procedure only works on propositional jforms.@End(Description)

@Section(MS90-9 search procedure)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(MS90-9)@\
Begin mating search MS90-9 on the current expansion proof.
Primitive substitutions and duplications are performed systematically,
with multiple jforms being worked on simultaneously.  On each
particular jform, the search procedure MS90-3 is used.  The flags
MAX-SEARCH-LIMIT, SEARCH-TIME-LIMIT, and RANK-EPROOF-FN are used to
control the search.  See also the command SHOW-OPTION-TREE.@End(Description)

@Section(MS91-6 and MS91-7 search procedures)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(MS91-6)@\
Begin mating search MS91-6 on the current expansion proof.
Primitive substitutions and duplications are performed systematically,
with multiple jforms being worked on simultaneously.  On each
particular jform, the search procedure MS88 is used.  The flags
MAX-SEARCH-LIMIT and SEARCH-TIME-LIMIT are used to control the amount
of time spent on each jform.

The order in which the possible jforms are considered depends on a 
number of flags. Firstly, the primitive substitutions which are generated 
are determined by the values of MAX-PRIM-DEPTH, MIN-PRIM-DEPTH,
PRIM-QUANTIFIER and NEG-PRIM-SUB. If DUP-ALLOWED is T, then additional
options are generated corresponding to duplicated quantifiers. These
options are then combined into sets; because there can be many such sets,
the flag NEW-OPTION-SET-LIMIT controls how many are generated at once.
Each set is given a weighting (see flags WEIGHT-x-COEFFICIENT and 
WEIGHT-x-FN, for x = A,B,C), and the lowest-weighted set is chosen
for searching. If the weight of the lowest-weighted set is too large,
TPS may generate more sets; the interpretation of "too large" is given
by MS91-WEIGHT-LIMIT-RANGE. If the search fails, it will be discarded;
if it runs out of time then it will be re-weighted to be continued
later (see RECONSIDER-FN).

@IndexOther(MS91-7)@\
Begin mating search MS91-7 on the current expansion proof.
Primitive substitutions and duplications are performed systematically,
with multiple jforms being worked on simultaneously.  On each
particular jform, the search procedure MS90-3 is used.  The flags
MAX-SEARCH-LIMIT and SEARCH-TIME-LIMIT are used to control the amount
of time spent on each jform.

later (see RECONSIDER-FN).@End(Description)

@Section(MS92-9 search procedure)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(MS92-9)@\
Call mating search procedure MS92-9 on the current eproof.  This
procedure uses a naive level-saturation method, exhaustively searching
a single jform before applying any duplications. Quantifier duplications
are applied uniformly to outermost quantifiers. Will try primitive
substitution for outermost variable only.  Works on only a single
jform at a time.
The procedure is almost identical to MS88, except that the flag
NUM-OF-DUPS is used to govern how many times the outermost quantifier
may be duplicated. The internal representation of variables is as in
MS90-3.@End(Description)

@Section(MS93-1 search procedure)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(MS93-1)@\
Begin mating search MS93-1 on the current expansion proof.
The search is basically identical to MS89, but is performed using the 
internal variable representations of MS90-9.
Primitive substitutions and duplications are performed systematically,
with multiple jforms being worked on simultaneously.  On each
particular jform, the search procedure MS92-9 is used.  The flags
MAX-SEARCH-LIMIT, SEARCH-TIME-LIMIT, and RANK-EPROOF-FN are used to
control the search. See also the command SHOW-OPTION-TREE.@End(Description)

@Section(MS98-1 search procedure)

@Begin(Description)

tree, then applies Pfenning's MERGE algorithm, eliminating redundant 
expansion terms.@End(Description)

@Section(Vpforms)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(CJFORM)@\
Create a new jform for the expansion tree associated with the

@Section(Mtree Operations)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(ADD-CONN) @i{literal1} @i{oblig1} @i{literal2} @i{oblig2}@\
Add a connection. The subsumption is considered.
The usage of the command is exactly as the usage of ADD-CONN in MATE.

@IndexOther(CHOOSE-BRANCH)@\
Remove all matingstree branches except the one leading to the 
current matingstree node (which must be a leaf of the matingstree, and must
be complete). This will also do some preliminary merging, by deleting all 
of the jforms which are associated with the deleted nodes.

@IndexOther(COMPLETE-P)@\
Check the completeness of the current mating. The usage of the command is 
exactly the same as the usage of the mate command COMPLETE-P.

@IndexOther(D) @i{node} @i{matingstree}@\
Go down one level. D <nth> means go down along the nth subnode.
Counting begins from 0. Without argument, D means go down along the 
leftmost subnode.

@IndexOther(GOTO) @i{node} @i{matingstree}@\
GOTO <node> means to go to the given node. If <node> is not given,
it means to go to the root of the matingstree

@IndexOther(INIT)@\
Initialize the matingstree. This is done automatically 
when you enter the matingstree top level, but can be used 
subsequently to return everything to the state it was in when 
you first entered the mtree top level.

@IndexOther(KILL) @i{node}@\
KILL <node> means to mark the given node and 
all nodes below it as dead.

@IndexOther(PICK) @i{literal} @i{obligation}@\
Pick a leaf which you may try to mate with another later.
(MB: I think that PICK N behaves as though you had just 
added a connection to N, and generates the appropriate
obligations, without actually demanding another leaf to
connect with. I think.)

@IndexOther(PRUNE)@\
Remove all dead leaves below (but not including) 
the current matingstree.

@IndexOther(REM-NODE)@\
Remove the last connection. The subsumption is considered.
If the node is the root, the whole matingstree is removed. The 
usage of the command is exactly the as the usage of REM-LAST-CONN. 
Please check the help message for REM-LAST-CONN if necessary.

@IndexOther(RESURRECT) @i{node}@\
RESURRECT <node> means to mark the given node and 
all nodes below it as alive.

@IndexOther(SHOW-MATING)@\
Show the connections in the mating associated with the current node.

@IndexOther(SHOW-SUBSTS)@\
Show the substitution stack associated with a matingstree node.

@IndexOther(SIB) @i{matingstree}@\
Go to the next sibling of this node.

@IndexOther(UNIFY)@\
Go into UNIFY toplevel and check the UTREE structure
associated with the current node in the matingstree. The 
unification tree associated with the mating is passed on 
to the unification top-level. Any changes made to this tree 
are destructive. Applicable only for a higher-order unification 
problem. Mainly use to check the UTREE structure.

node is given, the current matingstree is used.

@IndexOther(PMTR) @i{name}@\
Print out the given matingstree as a tree, showing the obligations at each 
node. If no matingstree is given, the current-matingstree is printed out. 

Matingstrees enclosed in curly brackets are marked as dead.
Branches with *'s denote nodes that are being omitted for lack of space. The 
cure for this is to either start printing from a node lower in the tree, or 
make the screen wider. See also PMTR*.

@IndexOther(PMTR*) @i{name}@\
Print out the given matingstree as a tree, showing the obligations at each 
node. If no matingstree is given, the current-matingstree is printed out. 

Numbers in round brackets are open obligations. If the brackets end in "..",
there are too many open obligations to fit under the mstree label. 

Leaves underlined with ^'s are closed matingstrees. 
Matingstrees enclosed in curly brackets are marked as dead.
Branches with *'s denote nodes that are being omitted for lack of space. The 
cure for this is to either start printing from a node lower in the tree, or 
make the screen wider. See also PMTR.

the tree below the current obligation is printed out. 

Numbers in round brackets are open obligations; those in square brackets are
closed. 
Branches with *'s denote nodes that are being omitted for lack of space.
The cure for this is to either start printing from a node lower in the tree,
or make the screen wider.

@IndexOther(POTR*-FLAT) @i{name}@\
Print out the given obligation tree in flat form, 
with the jforms attached to all nodes. If no argument is given,
the whole obligation tree is printed out.

@IndexOther(POTR-FLAT) @i{name}@\

@IndexOther(APPLY-SUBST) @i{var} @i{term}@\
Apply a substitution, suggested by the user, to the current topnode.
Modifies the unification tree.

@IndexOther(EPROOF-UTREE)@\
Create a new utree whose root has all the dpairs
associated with the current mating. (The existing utree may
have some of the dpairs added lower down the tree; this will
bring them all to the top). See also NAME-DPAIR.

@IndexOther(GO)@\
Call unification in automatic mode. Will search for unifiers
only below the current-topnode.

@IndexOther(GOTO) @i{name}@\
Go to the specified node in the unification tree.

@IndexOther(MATCH)@\
This command is applicable only if current-topnode is a non-terminal
leaf node. Calls TPS's version of Huet's MATCH algorithm to find substitutions
at the current topnode. The pair selected by MATCH is determined by the value 
of the flag APPLY-MATCH.

@IndexOther(MATCH-PAIR) @i{n}@\
This command is applicable only if current-topnode is a non-terminal
leaf node. Calls TPS's version of Huet's MATCH algorithm to find 
substitutions at the current topnode. n refers to the nth dpair, 
and this must be a flexible-rigid dpair.

@IndexOther(NAME-DPAIR) @i{name}@\
Give a name to the dpairset associated with the current topnode.
This is most useful when UNIFY has been issued from the MATE top
level, and you want to name the current dpair so that you can save
it in the library. See also EPROOF-UTREE.

@IndexOther(NTH-SON) @i{n}@\
Go to the nth descendant of the current-topnode. Instead of
using this command, you can simply type n on the unification top level to
go to the nth descendant. It has no effect if the current-topnode has
no descendents.

@IndexOther(P) @i{name}@\
Displays the current unification node; show its name,
measure, number of descendants, substitutions added and free
variables. Does not display the disagreement pairs (use PP or
PP* for that), or the cumulative substitutions from this node 
to the root (use SUBST-STACK for that).

@IndexOther(PALL) @i{name} @i{filename} @i{verbose}@\
Displays all the disagreement pairs at every node below the
given node. (Similar to PP, but for the entire tree below the current
node.)

@IndexOther(PP)@\
Displays the disagreement pairs at the current node. See also PP*. 
More information about the current node is given by the command P.

@IndexOther(PP*)@\
Displays the disagreement pairs at the current-topnode, including the order of
each pair and other information. See also PP. The other information displayed
includes (for each wff, each disagreement pair and the whole set of 
disagreement pairs):
1) the order (e.g. "x(i)" is first order, and so on).
2) whether it is monadic (all function constants are unary).
3) whether it is linear (all free vars occur once only).
4) whether it is a matching problem (one side of a dpair has no free vars).
5) whether it is a relaxed pattern (all free vars have only bound vars as
   arguments).
6) whether it is a pattern (all free vars have distinct bound vars as 
   arguments).
7) whether a disagreement pair is variable-disjoint (the free vars on the
   left are disjoint from those on the right).
8) whether the set of disagreement pairs can be partitioned into sets in 
   which each free var in the whole problem occurs in at most one set.
9) whether there are any free vars that occur only once, or not at all, in 
   the whole problem.
These conditions all appear in the literature on higher-order unification; 
see, for example, Prehofer's paper in CADE '94.

More information about the current node is given by the command P.

@IndexOther(SIMPLIFY)@\
A call to TPS's version of Huet's SIMPL algorithm. Dpairs in the 
current topnode are replaced by the dpairs returned by the call. It will 
also find substitutions of the form (var . term) provided `var' does not
occur in `term'. This command will alter the unification tree.

@IndexOther(STATS)@\
Statistics about the current unification tree.

@IndexOther(SUBST-STACK) @i{filename}@\
Displays the substitution stack for the current topnode.
See also P, PP, PP* for other information about the current node.

@IndexOther(UTREE) @i{name} @i{filename} @i{verbose}@\
Displays the unification tree and the associated substitutions at
each node which is below the specified node. Display is in a flat
format; UTREE* prints the same information in a tree format.

@IndexOther(UTREE*) @i{name} @i{print-subs}@\
Displays the unification tree and the associated substitutions at
each node which is below the specified node. Display is in a tree
format; UTREE prints the same information in a flat format. Display 
shows nodes as numbers, followed by I for imitation, P for projection,
~ for negation, A for administrative (e.g. anything generated by SIMPL).
Optionally shows the most recent substitution on the subst-stack at 
each node.

@IndexOther(^)@\

@IndexOther(EXHAUSTIVE-SEARCH) @i{modename} @i{testwin}@\
Equivalent to setting TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN to EXHAUSTIVE-SEARCH
and then typing GO. Permanently changes TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN.

@IndexOther(FIND-BEST-MODE) @i{modename} @i{testwin}@\
This command effectively runs PUSH-UP until it finds
a mode that works, and then runs PRESS-DOWN until it finds the
best mode it can.
Before using this command, use the MODE command to 
set up a mode in which the current theorem can not be proven. Also
check the value of the TEST-INCREASE-TIME flag (it should probably
not be zero).
Then PUSH-UP will systematically vary the values of the flags
listed in the TEST-EASIER-IF-* flags, using the PUSH-UP search
function (see the help message for TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN).
Once a correct mode is discovered, it will systematically vary
the values of the flags listed in the TEST-FASTER-IF-* flags,
using the PRESS-DOWN search function, until it finds as good a 
mode as it can.
The values of TEST-REDUCE-TIME, TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN, 
TEST-INCREASE-TIME and TEST-FIX-UNIF-DEPTHS will be permanently
changed.

The window can be closed with the command CLOSE-TESTWIN. The size 
of the text is determined by the flag CHARSIZE, and the current width of the window 
by the flag TESTWIN-WIDTH. The initial height of the window is determined by 
TESTWIN-HEIGHT.

@IndexOther(PRESS-DOWN) @i{modename} @i{testwin}@\
Before using this command, use the MODE command to 
set up a mode in which the current theorem can be proven. Also
check the value of the TEST-INITIAL-TIME-LIMIT flag (it should
be high enough that the first attempt at proof will succeed).
Then PRESS-DOWN will systematically vary the values of the flags
listed in the TEST-FASTER-IF-* flags, using the PRESS-DOWN search
function (see the help message for TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN).
The values of TEST-REDUCE-TIME, TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN and 
TEST-FIX-UNIF-DEPTHS will be permanently changed (to T, PRESS-DOWN
and T respectively).

Note that this is NOT the same as PRESS-DOWN-2, since it automatically
generates a searchlist rather than relying on the user to provide one.

@IndexOther(PRESS-DOWN-2) @i{modename} @i{testwin}@\
Equivalent to setting TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN to PRESS-DOWN-2
and then typing GO. Permanently changes TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN.
Note that this is NOT the same as typing PRESS-DOWN; this will
use the user-defined searchlist rather than an automatically
generated one.

@IndexOther(PUSH-UP) @i{modename} @i{testwin}@\
This command effectively runs PUSH-UP until it finds
a mode that works, and then stops.
Before using this command, use the MODE command to 
set up a mode in which the current theorem can not be proven. Also
check the value of the TEST-INCREASE-TIME flag (it should probably
not be zero).
Then PUSH-UP will systematically vary the values of the flags
listed in the TEST-EASIER-IF-* flags, using the PUSH-UP search
function (see the help message for TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN).
The value of TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN will be changed to PUSH-UP.

Note that this is NOT the same as PUSH-UP-2, since it automatically
generates a searchlist rather than relying on the user to provide one

@IndexOther(PUSH-UP-2) @i{modename} @i{testwin}@\
Equivalent to setting TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN to PUSH-UP-2
and then typing GO. Permanently changes TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN.
Note that this is NOT the same as typing PUSH-UP; this will
use the user-defined searchlist rather than an automatically
generated one.

@IndexOther(SEARCH-ORDER) @i{name}@\
Show the order in which things will be changed if the search is
started now using the given searchlist.@End(Description)

@Section(Searchlists)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(ADD-FLAG) @i{flag} @i{init} @i{range}@\
Add a single flag to the current searchlist.
To change the current searchlist, use NEW-SEARCHLIST.

@IndexOther(ADD-FLAG*)@\
Repeatedly add new flags to the current searchlist.

@IndexOther(ADD-FUNCTION) @i{name}@\
Add a function to a searchlist. This function will be evaluated on 
every iteration of the search, and will generally reset certain flags.
The special functions defined so far are:
UNIFORM-SEARCH-FUNCTION sets max-utree-depth, max-search-limit and max-substs-quick
using the values of max-search-depth, search-time-limit and max-substs-var respectively,
and then sets TEST-INITIAL-TIME-LIMIT to allow 5 option sets on the first try, then
10, then 15, and so on.
BASIC-SEARCH-THEN-UNIFORM-SEARCH runs the current searchlist once over, allowing
1 hour for each setting of the flags. Then it switches the searchlist to
UNIFORM-SEARCH-2 and continues with that.

@IndexOther(ADD-SUBJECTS) @i{subjects}@\
Add all the flags concerning the given subjects to the current 
searchlist.

@IndexOther(NEW-SEARCHLIST) @i{name}@\
Make a new searchlist; i.e. begin a new list of flags to be varied.
This command also changes the current searchlist.

@IndexOther(QUICK-DEFINE) @i{name} @i{succ}@\
Define a searchlist the quick and dirty way!
If the current flag settings are OK (i.e. are a successful mode),
will create a searchlist in which the flags given in the values of 
the TEST-FASTER-* flags (do LIST TEST-TOP for a listing) vary over 
values which ought to give a faster search than the current values.
If the current flag settings are not OK, will create a searchlist in 
which the flags given in the values of the TEST-EASIER-* flags vary
over values which ought to make the search easier than the current 
values.
The maximum number of values for any flag to take is governed 
by TEST-MAX-SEARCH-VALUES.

@IndexOther(REM-FLAG) @i{flag}@\
Remove a single flag from the current searchlist.
To change the current searchlist, use NEW-SEARCHLIST.

@IndexOther(REM-FLAG*)@\
Repeatedly remove flags from the current searchlist.

@IndexOther(REVISE-DEFAULTS) @i{old-slist} @i{new-slist}@\
For each flag in the given searchlist, change the default setting to 
the current value of the flag, and put the default setting into the range
(unless it's already there). This is useful in conjunction with SCALE-UP 
and SCALE-DOWN; you can keep one searchlist (let's call it MASTER-SLIST) 
containing all of the flags you're likely to want to vary. Then if the 
current flag settings are a good mode and you want to try and find a better 
one, do REVISE-DEFAULTS followed by SCALE-DOWN MASTER-SLIST; if the current
settings are a bad mode and you want to try to find one that works, do 
REVISE-DEFAULTS followed by SCALE-UP MASTER-SLIST.

@IndexOther(SCALE-DOWN) @i{old-slist} @i{new-slist}@\
Rewrites a searchlist under the assumption that the initial
values in the searchlist (together with appropriate settings of the other
flags) constitute a successful mode, and that TEST is being run in order 
to find a faster mode. This will discard all settings that would make the
search slower, and will arrange the range of values in such a way that the
bounds of the search will gradually decrease until the proof cannot be 
completed. If this makes the range empty or a singleton, the flag is removed
from the searchlist. See the TEST-FASTER-* flags

@IndexOther(SCALE-UP) @i{old-slist} @i{new-slist}@\
Rewrites a searchlist under the assumption that the initial
values in the searchlist (together with appropriate settings of the other
flags) do not constitute a successful mode, and that TEST is being run in order
to find a mode that works. This will discard all settings that would make the 
search harder, and will arrange the range of values in such a way that the 
bounds of the search will gradually increase until the proof (with a bit of 
luck) can be completed. If this makes the range empty or a singleton, the flag 
is removed from the searchlist. See the TEST-EASIER-* flags.

@IndexOther(SEARCHLISTS)@\
Print a list of all searchlists currently in memory.

@IndexOther(SHOW-SEARCHLIST) @i{name}@\
Show contents of a searchlist.

@IndexOther(VARY-MODE) @i{modename} @i{slistname} @i{use-mode}@\
Go through an existing mode, flag by flag, creating a searchlist
by picking out relevant flags from it. All useless flags (i.e. ones that 
cannot affect the search time) will be automatically stripped out. The
default flag value in the searchlist will be its value in the mode.
You can also optionally set the current flag values to the values 
in the mode (equivalent to the MODE command).@End(Description)

@Section(Library)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(DELETE) @i{name} @i{type}@\
Delete a saved searchlist or mode (equivalent to the library
command DELETE.

@IndexOther(FETCH) @i{name} @i{type}@\
Retrieve a searchlist or mode from the library. Exactly like the 
library function FETCH, except that when a searchlist is retrieved, it
will become the current searchlist.

@IndexOther(INSERT) @i{name} @i{type} @i{comment}@\
Like the library command INSERT; will save a 
searchlist in the library. Will also save a mode that has been found 
by using GO.@End(Description)

Leave MODELS to the next enclosing top level.@End(Description)

@Section(Printing)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(PELT) @i{tp} @i{elt}@\
Print the integer in notation appropriate to the given type.
For example, elements of type (OA) are printed in set notation.
The empty set is called EMPTY and the universal set is called FULL.

Constant functions are denoted by Kc.

A few special cases are T and F at type O, NOT at type (OO),
the binary connectives AND, OR, IMPLIES, EQUIV and XOR at type (OOO),
PI and SIGMA at types of the form (O(OA)),
= at types of the form (OAA) and 
ID at types of the form (AA).

EMPTY at a type (OA) corresponds to the empty set.

FULL at a type (OA) corresponds to the set of all elements of type A.

PI at a type (O(OA)) corresponds to the singleton {FULL} where FULL 
corresponds to the set of all elements of type A.

SIGMA at a type (O(OA)) corresponds to the set containing all sets of
type A except EMPTY.

For elements of low types the command PELT-REC may also be helpful.

SEE ALSO: PELT-REC

@IndexOther(PELT-REC) @i{tp} @i{elt}@\
Print the integer in notation appropriate to the given type.
For example, elements of type (OA) are printed in set notation.
The empty set is called EMPTY and the universal set is called FULL.

Constant functions are denoted by K(c).

A few special cases are T and F at type O, NOT at type (OO), 
the binary connectives AND, OR, IMPLIES, EQUIV and XOR at type (OOO),
PI and SIGMA at types of the form (O(OA)),
= at types of the form (OAA) and 
ID at types of the form (AA).

EMPTY at a type (OA) corresponds to the empty set.

FULL at a type (OA) corresponds to the set of all elements of type A.

PI at a type (O(OA)) corresponds to the singleton {FULL} where FULL 
corresponds to the set of all elements of type A.

SIGMA at a type (O(OA)) corresponds to the set containing all sets of
type A except EMPTY.

This command is recursive.  For low types this is helpful, but
the notation becomes unwieldy for higher types.  For higher types
the command PELT is more appropriate.

This must be a power of 2.

@IndexOther(COND-PROBABILITY) @i{wff1} @i{wff2}@\
Computes the conditional probability that a wff2 is true if a wff1 is
true in the model.  Assigned variables are considered fixed.  All
unassigned variables are allowed to vary over the appropriate domains.
The probability is the number of values for these unassigned variables
for which wff1 and wff2 are true over the number of values for which
wff1 is true.

SEE ALSO: PROBABILITY, INTERPRET, MAX-BINDER-COMPUTATION, MAX-DOMAIN-SIZE

@IndexOther(INTERPRET) @i{wff}@\
Interpret a formula in the current model.  The evaluation is lazy so
if a function is constant, the argument is not evaluated.  The flags
MAX-BINDER-COMPUTATION and MAX-DOMAIN-SIZE bound how complicated the
wff can be before interpret will fail.

SEE ALSO: ASSIGN-VAR, SHOW-ASSIGNMENTS, REMOVE-ALL-ASSIGNMENTS, UNASSIGN-VAR,
  MAX-BINDER-COMPUTATION, MAX-DOMAIN-SIZE

@IndexOther(PROBABILITY) @i{wff}@\

variables so that the given proposition is true.

If the domains involved are large, TPS will ask the user whether to
print the values to the screen or save them to a file.

TPS will always tell the user whether there are no solutions for any
inputs, solutions for some but not all inputs, solutions for all
inputs and whether there are unique solutions for some inputs.

@IndexOther(UNASSIGN-VAR) @i{v}@\
Remove an assignment for a variable in the current model.

weak label name should not already exist (if it does, remove it
using RW). The wffs that are saved to this file can be reloaded
using the command QLOAD "savedwffs.lisp".
  This command dates from before the LIBRARY top level was 
introduced; you should probably avoid it. If you want to save

@IndexOther(KEY) @i{string} @i{backup}@\
Search for a string in the names of all library objects. If
the given string is also a keyword (see SHOW-KEYWORDS), then the keywords
for each library object will also be searched. This command does not search
the help messages of library objects.

@IndexOther(LIBFILES)@\
Lists all library files in the current default directories,
or in a single chosen directory.

@IndexOther(LIBOBJECTS-IN-FILE) @i{file}@\
Lists the contents of a file.

If more than one file of the given name is found in the library directories
in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR, the user is prompted to choose one.

@IndexOther(LIST-OF-LIBOBJECTS) @i{type} @i{backup}@\
List all objects or all objects of specified TYPE.

@IndexOther(SCRIBE-ALL-WFFS) @i{backup} @i{filter} @i{fname} @i{verbosity}@\
Write all wffs in all files in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR (and optionally BACKUP-LIB-DIR)
to an mss file.
The three verbosity settings are: MIN, which just shows the names of the 
objects, MED, which shows the help messages, keywords, provability and wffs 
as well, and MAX, which shows everything. 
As a filter, you can select any known keywords; only the wffs which 
satisfy all of the given keywords will be shown. See SHOW-KEYWORDS 
for a list of keywords.

@IndexOther(SCRIBELIBDIR) @i{directory} @i{types} @i{filename} @i{verbosity} @i{eject}@\
Print all the library files in a given directory into 
MSS files. See SCRIBELIBFILE for details.

@IndexOther(SCRIBELIBFILE) @i{filenamesin} @i{filenamesout} @i{verbosity}@\
Print the specified library files into MSS files.
The three verbosity settings are: MIN, which just shows the names of the 
objects, MED, which shows the help messages, keywords, provability and wffs 
as well, and MAX, which shows everything. It can take a list of filenames and 
a corresponding list of output files; if the latter list is too long it will 
be truncated, and if it is too short then the last filename given will be used 
for all the remaining output (so you can write a group of library files to a 
single output file by only supplying one output filename).  
After leaving TPS, run the .mss files through Scribe and print the resulting
files.

Some files in the list of library files may be ambiguous, in the 
sense that more than one file of the given name exists in the 
library directories in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR.  
In this case, the user is prompted to disambiguate each ambiguous
filename from first to last.

@IndexOther(SEARCH) @i{type} @i{stringlist} @i{backup}@\
Search the entire library, including all comments, for any one
of a given list of strings, and return the names of all objects which
contain such a string. This is useful for finding out, for example,
which gwffs can be proven using either MS88 or MS89.
WARNING: THIS COMMAND IS SLOW, AND CAN USE A LOT OF MEMORY.
You might want to think about using the Unix "grep" command instead.

@IndexOther(SEARCH2) @i{type} @i{stringlist} @i{backup}@\
Search the entire library, including all comments, for a 
given combination of strings. See also SEARCH.
The syntax for the given list is essentially conjunctive normal
form -- it should be a list of conjuncts, each of which is a list of 
disjuncts.
For example:
((MS88) (THM)) finds everything containing THM and MS88
((MS88 THM)) finds everything containing THM or MS88
((MS88 MS89) (THM EXERCISE)) finds everything containing (MS88 or MS89)
                             and (THM or EXERCISE).
WARNING: THIS COMMAND IS SLOW, AND CAN USE A LOT OF MEMORY.
You might want to think about using the Unix "grep" command instead.

@IndexOther(SHOW) @i{name} @i{type}@\
Display a library object.

If more than one library object of this name is stored in
the library and SHOW-ALL-LIBOBJECTS is set to T,
the user is prompted to disambiguate.

@IndexOther(SHOW*-WFF) @i{name}@\
Display the wff of a gwff in the library, with the associated
help message, keywords and provability status.
Also shows any needed objects, such as the definition and
help for abbrevations used in the gwff.

@IndexOther(SHOW-ALL-WFFS) @i{backup} @i{filter}@\
Show all wffs in all files in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR (and optionally BACKUP-LIB-DIR).
As a filter, you can select any known keywords; only the wffs which 
satisfy all of the given keywords will be shown. See SHOW-KEYWORDS 
for a list of keywords.

@IndexOther(SHOW-HELP) @i{name} @i{type}@\
Display the help message associated with a library object.

If more than one library object of this name is stored in
the library and SHOW-ALL-LIBOBJECTS is set to T,
the user is prompted to disambiguate.

@IndexOther(SHOW-OBJECTS-IN-FILE) @i{file} @i{types}@\
Lists all the objects of the given type (or types) in a file.

If more than one file of the given name is found in the library directories
in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR, the user is prompted to choose one.

@IndexOther(SHOW-TIMING) @i{name} @i{screen}@\
Display the timing information of a gwff in the library.
NOTE: Will only display timing information that has been recorded 
in standard DATEREC format.
If you opt for output to go to a file as well as to the screen, 
the format of the file will be SCRIBE or TEX if this is the current
value of the STYLE flag, and GENERIC otherwise.

@IndexOther(SHOW-WFF) @i{name}@\
Display the wff of a gwff in the library.

If more than one library object of this name is stored in
the library and SHOW-ALL-LIBOBJECTS is set to T,
the user is prompted to disambiguate.

@IndexOther(SHOW-WFF&HELP) @i{name}@\
Display the wff of a gwff in the library, with the associated
help message, keywords and provability status.

@IndexOther(SHOW-WFFS-IN-FILE) @i{file}@\

@IndexOther(TEX-ALL-WFFS) @i{backup} @i{filter} @i{fname} @i{verbosity}@\
Write all wffs in all files in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR (and optionally BACKUP-LIB-DIR)
to a TeX file. 
The three verbosity settings are: MIN, which just shows the names of the 
objects, MED, which shows the help messages, provability and wffs as well, and MAX, 
which shows everything.
As a filter, you can select any known keywords; only the wffs which 
satisfy all of the given keywords will be shown. See SHOW-KEYWORDS 
for a list of keywords.

@IndexOther(TEXLIBDIR) @i{directory} @i{types} @i{filename} @i{verbosity} @i{eject}@\
Print all the library files in a given directory into 
TEX files. See TEXLIBFILE for details.

@IndexOther(TEXLIBFILE) @i{filenamesin} @i{filenamesout} @i{verbosity}@\
Print the specified library files into TeX files.
The three verbosity settings are: MIN, which just shows the names of the 
objects, MED, which shows the help messages, keywords, provability and wffs 
as well, and MAX, which shows everything. It can take a list of filenames 
and a corresponding list of output files; if the latter list is too long it 
will be truncated, and if it is too short then the last filename given will 
be used for all the remaining output (so you can write a group of library 
files to a single output file by only supplying one output filename).  
After leaving TPS, run the .tex files through TeX and print the resulting
files.@End(Description)

@Section(Reading)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(DESTROY) @i{name}@\
Remove a library object from TPS (the object will remain
stored in the library).

@IndexOther(FETCH) @i{name} @i{type}@\
Make a library object available in TPS.
Will create a new TPS object if EXPERTFLAG is set to T, otherwise
will create a weak label for the new library object.

If more than one library object of this name is stored in
the library and SHOW-ALL-LIBOBJECTS is set to T,
the user is prompted to disambiguate.

@IndexOther(FIND-PROVABLE) @i{backup}@\
Look for gwffs with a certain provability status.

@IndexOther(RESTORE-MASTERINDEX)@\
Restore library master index. Normally this need not be done by the
user as it is done automatically when TPS is first entered. However, if
the contents of the library may have been changed from outside of TPS
(e.g. by a text editor) since TPS was started, then this command will
re-initialize the library index.

@IndexOther(RETRIEVE-FILE) @i{file}@\
Make all objects in a library file available in TPS. Objects in a
file are retrieved in the same order as they are stored in the file.

If more than one file of the given name is found in the library directories
in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR, the user is prompted to choose one.@End(Description)

@Section(Library Structure)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(COPY-LIBDIR) @i{omit-other-remarks}@\
COPY-LIBDIR can be used to copy a library directory into a
new library directory which TPS will automatically create,
or it can be used to copy the contents of a library directory into
an existing library directory.  If COPY-LIBDIR is copying into
an existing directory, and an object of the same name and type
exists in both the source and destination directory, the original
object remains in the destination directory instead of being overwritten.
The user has the option of omitting the other-remarks property
of the library objects.  If any needed-objects are left over,
the user is given the option of copying these extra needed-objects
into a new library file in the destination library directory.

COPY-LIBDIR will also copy the bestmodes and keywords files, if they
exist.  If the target directory already has a bestmodes or keywords
file, then the corresponding files will be merged.

@IndexOther(COPY-LIBFILE) @i{oldfile} @i{newfile} @i{omit-other-remarks}@\
Copy a file of library objects. The source file will
be found among the directories in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR
(the user will be prompted if more than one such file exists, and also
if there is a choice of directories for the new file).
Needed objects are not copied.

@IndexOther(CREATE-LIB-DIR) @i{directory}@\
Create a directory to store files containing library items.
This will not only create the directory, but create a file libindex.rec
so that TPS will recognize the directory as a library directory.
This command can be executed for the latter purpose even if the
directory already exists. 
This command will automatically add the directory to DEFAULT-LIB-DIR in
the current session of TPS.

@IndexOther(CREATE-LIB-SUBDIR) @i{subdir}@\
Creates a subdirectory of a current library directory
in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR to store files containing library items.
This will not only create the directory, but also creates a
LIB-MASTERINDEX-FILE so that TPS will recognize the directory as a 
library directory.  This command will also add the subdirectory to
DEFAULT-LIB-DIR.  TPS automatically looks for subdirectories when setting
DEFAULT-LIB-DIR, so there is no need to add the subdirectory to
the DEFAULT-LIB-DIR setting in the tps3.ini file.

@IndexOther(DELETE-LIB-DIR)@\
Deletes a library directory and removes it from DEFAULT-LIB-DIR.
The command will fail if the directory contains any library objects
(i.e., if the index file is not empty).

@IndexOther(DELETE-LIBFILE) @i{filename}@\
Delete a Library File

@IndexOther(MOVE-LIBFILE) @i{oldfile} @i{newfile}@\
Move a file of library objects. The source file will
be found among the directories in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR
(the user will be prompted if more than one such file exists, and also
if there is a choice of directories for the new file).
Needed objects are not moved.

@IndexOther(RENAME-LIBDIR)@\
Rename a Library Directory

@IndexOther(RENAME-LIBFILE) @i{oldfile} @i{newfile}@\
Rename a Library File (within the same library directory)

@IndexOther(UPDATE-LIBDIR) @i{omit-other-remarks} @i{directory}@\
UPDATE-LIBDIR can be used to update a (common) library directory
by copying any object from a directory DEFAULT-LIB-DIR or BACKUP-LIB-DIR
into the (common) library directory, if it is not already there.
Before updating from a library directory, the user is asked whether
to update from this directory.  This is so one can choose a collection
of library directories to combine into the common destination directory.

This has the same effect of 

1. calling COPY-LIBDIR with copying from each (chosen) directory in
DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR into the (common) destination
library directory.

2. Calling IMPORT-NEEDED-OBJECTS to ensure all needed-objects
are also put into the destination directory.

If one wants to get the latest version of all library items,
specify the complete pathname of a nonexistent directory when 
TPS prompts for a destination directory.@End(Description)

@Section(Editing)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(ADD-GOODMODES) @i{modes-gwffs} @i{newmodes} @i{newthms}@\
Add modes to a list of goodmodes.  Also, add theorems that these goodmodes can prove.

@IndexOther(CHANGE-PROVABILITY) @i{name}@\
Change the PROVABILITY attribute of a stored gwff.

If more than one library object of this name is stored in
the library and SHOW-ALL-LIBOBJECTS is set to T,
the user is prompted to disambiguate.

@IndexOther(CHECK-NEEDED-OBJECTS)@\
Checks for library objects which are not stored
in the chosen directory, but are needed by some object in
that directory.

@IndexOther(COPY-LIBOBJECT) @i{name} @i{type} @i{filename} @i{omit-other-remarks}@\
Copy an object from some specified directory to the default directory.
Does not copy the library entries of needed objects.

If more than one library object of this name is stored in
the library and SHOW-ALL-LIBOBJECTS is set to T,
the user is prompted to disambiguate.

@IndexOther(DELETE) @i{names} @i{type}@\
Delete an object from the library.

If more than one library object of this name is stored in
the library, the user is prompted to disambiguate.

@IndexOther(FIX-MODES)@\
Change all references to obsolete flags into the 
appropriate new flag setting, for every mode in your library
directory. You only need to do this once.
You will be prompted before anything is changed, and
you should probably keep a backup copy of your old library in
case disaster strikes!
THE CODE FOR THIS COMMAND SHOULD BE REWRITTEN FOR EACH 
RELEVANT CHANGE TO THE TPS FLAGS.
At the minute, it's set up to remove references to 
REWRITE-DEFNS-EAGER, REWRITE-EQUAL-EXT and REWRITE-ONLY-EXT,
which have been removed, and to reset REWRITE-DEFNS
and REWRITE-EQUALITIES to appropriate values.
It also puts LAST-MODE-NAME at the head of all settings
for RECORDFLAGS.

@IndexOther(IMPORT-NEEDED-OBJECTS) @i{omit-other-remarks}@\
Copies library objects which are not stored
in the chosen directory, but are needed by some object in
that directory, into the directory.  If there is a choice
of objects to import, and SHOW-ALL-LIBOBJECTS is set to T,
then the user is prompted to choose one.

@IndexOther(INSERT) @i{name} @i{type}@\
Insert an item in the library. 
The INSERT command can be used to create a new library object or
to modify existing entries in the library.  If SHOW-ALL-LIBOBJECTS
is set to T, the user is prompted to indicate which existing
library object to modify or which library directory into which
the new object should be inserted. If AUTO-KEYWORDS is set to T, 
executing INSERT-LIBOBJECT requires expanding all definitions, 
which can take an enormous amount of time when definitions are 
deeply nested.

All the items will be replaced by whatever you write
(or kept the same if you use the default) except for "additional
remarks"; what you specify here will be added to whatever is already
there. If you don't want to add additional remarks, respond with
<space><return>. Use your favorite editor to make any changes within
the existing comment.

@IndexOther(INSERT-TPTP) @i{source-file} @i{destination-file} @i{suffix}@\
Insert a TPTP Problem into the library. 
The INSERT-TPTP command can be used to create a new library file 
containing abbreviations and theorems from a TPTP formatted file 
(.tps file). The destination directory is set according to the flag
AUTO-LIB-DIR. It will not overwrite or delete any existing items: 
new items need to have different names, hence the suffix.
If AUTO-KEYWORDS is set to T, executing INSERT-TPTP requires 
expanding all definitions, which can take an enormous amount of time 
when definitions are deeply nested.

@IndexOther(INSERT-TPTP*) @i{source-directory}@\
For each TPTP Problem in the source directory, insert 
a new file into the library. The INSERT-TPTP* command can be used 
to create new library files containing abbreviations and theorems 
from a directory of TPTP formatted files (.tps file). The destination
directory is set accordig to the flag AUTO-LIB-DIR. It will not 
overwrite or delete any existing items: new items need to have 
different names.
If AUTO-KEYWORDS is set to T, executing INSERT-TPTP* requires 
expanding all definitions, which can take an enormous amount of time 
when definitions are deeply nested.

@IndexOther(MOVE-LIBOBJECT) @i{name} @i{type} @i{filename}@\
Move an object from one library file to another.
This command will also move a list of objects (either all of the same type, or
all of type NIL), into a single named file.

@IndexOther(REFORMAT) @i{file}@\
Reformat the specified file. Will attempt to load all the objects 
in a given file and then to rewrite that file in the standard library format.
This can be useful if you manually edit your library files a lot and they've 
started to look a little disorganized.
To reformat all files in your directories, use SPRING-CLEAN.

@IndexOther(REINDEX) @i{file} @i{reformat}@\
Reindex and reformat the specified file --- i.e. reconstruct the 
entries in the library master index relating to the objects in a 
particular file (you should only need this if you've been manually editing 
the libindex.rec file and have accidentally lost some entries...), and then
attempt to load and rewrite the file.
To reindex all files in your directories, use SPRING-CLEAN.
If you get an error because of parsing problems, try again but answer
no to "Reformat?" (it is not possible to format a file without 
parsing it).

@IndexOther(REMOVE-GOODMODES) @i{modes-gwffs} @i{rmodes} @i{rthms}@\
Remove modes from a list of goodmodes.  Also, remove theorems that these goodmodes can prove.

@IndexOther(RENAME-OBJECT) @i{name} @i{type} @i{newname}@\
Change the name of a library object. Does not move the object or 
alter it in any other way.

@IndexOther(SORT) @i{file} @i{head}@\
Sort the specified file into alphabetical order, except for the
given list of objects which are put at the head of the file (if they were 
originally in the file). This command reads in the entire file and then
rewrites it; it will incidentally also catch any parsing errors.

@IndexOther(SPRING-CLEAN) @i{reindex} @i{reformat} @i{sort} @i{delete}@\
Will do its best to reindex, reformat and/or sort every file in the 
default library directory. If your files are a real mess, you might consider
using emacs to get rid of the worst of the problems before using SPRING-CLEAN.
It will also delete any file in the directory that doesn't belong there
Generally this means everything except .lib and libindex.rec files; you will be 
asked for confirmation before each file is deleted.
If you get an error because of parsing problems, try again but answer
no to "Reformat?" and "Sort?" (it is not possible to reformat or sort 
a file that cannot be parsed). Better yet, delete the unparseable entry and
try again.@End(Description)

@Section(Keywords)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(ADD-KEYWORD) @i{keyword} @i{defn}@\
Add a keyword to the keywords.rec file in your default directory.
This must be done before the keyword can be used anywhere else in the 
library.

@IndexOther(CHANGE-KEYWORDS) @i{name}@\
Change the keywords attribute of a stored library object.
NOTE: not all keywords can be changed. TPS may modify your list of
keywords -- for example, if you specify FIRST-ORDER for a problem
that is higher-order, TPS will change it.

@IndexOther(SHOW-KEYWORDS)@\
List all of the current acceptable keywords for the library.

@IndexOther(UPDATE-KEYWORDS)@\
For each library entry, update the keywords field
to include all of those keywords that can be determined automatically.
Any other keywords will be left untouched.
If you answer NO to the question about checking existing keywords, then 
this command will just attempt to fill in keywords for those objects 
which have none. If you answer YES, keywords will be generated for all 
of the objects (but existing user-defined  keywords will not be overwritten).

This command will almost certainly crash if it discovers any untypable 
definitions, missing needed-objects, circular definitions, misprints, etc...
in your library.
This probably won't damage your library, but you might want to make
a backup of all your files before you call this, just in case...@End(Description)

@Section(Best modes)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexOther(ADD-BESTMODE) @i{theorem} @i{mode} @i{date} @i{time} @i{comment} @i{auto-test}@\
Add a mode for the specified theorem to the list in your
bestmodes.rec file. If the theorem and mode are already present in 
the list (either in your directory or in another user's), you will
be asked to confirm the creation of a new entry. If they are already 
present in your own directory, you will be given the option of 
overwriting them.

The TEST-INIT command sets the flag TEST-THEOREMS to a collection
of theorems associated with bestmodes.  TPS-TEST uses this list
to perform automatic testing.  ADD-BESTMODE gives you the option 
(using the argument AUTO-TEST) of having TEST-INIT include the 
new theorem/bestmode pair for automatic testing.  (The default 
is to include it.)  If the mode is intended to be used interactively 
(e.g., for a demo), then it should not be included for automatic testing.

See Also: TPS-TEST, TEST-INIT, TEST-THEOREMS

@IndexOther(DELETE-BESTMODE) @i{theorem}@\
Remove an existing entry in your own bestmodes.rec file.
Attempting to remove an entry in another user's bestmode.rec
file will fail.

@IndexOther(FIND-DUP-MODES)@\
List all potential duplicates in the bestmodes.rec file.

@IndexOther(MODIFY-BESTMODE) @i{theorem}@\
Edit an existing entry in the bestmodes.rec file. 
Attempting to modify a read-only mode (i.e. one in another user's
directory) will create a modified copy in your own directory.

@IndexOther(SHOW-BESTMODE) @i{theorem}@\
List all of the current best modes for theorems in the library.
Shows mode name, date, time for proof, and whether the mode is read/write
(in your library) or read-only (in someone else's library).

@IndexOther(SHOW-BESTMODE-THMS)@\
List all of the theorems that have bestmodes in bestmodes.rec files.

@IndexOther(SHOW-NEW-BESTMODES) @i{date}@\
List all of the best modes which have been added since the 
given date. This will search all available bestmodes.rec files,
including those in other people's library directories.

@IndexOther(UPDATE-PROVABILITY)@\
Update the PROVABILITY attribute of all the gwffs for which a 
best mode is known.@End(Description)

@IndexOther(CLASSIFY-ITEM) @i{itemname} @i{classname}@\
Puts the library item into the given class within the
current library classification scheme.  If the item has needed objects,
TPS also offers to classify these.  If the flag CLASS-DIRECTION
is set to UP, the needed objects must be classified in ancestors
of the given class.  If the flag CLASS-DIRECTION is set to DOWN, 
the needed objects must be classified in descendants of the given class.

@IndexOther(CREATE-CLASS-SCHEME) @i{name} @i{help}@\
Create a classification scheme for the library.  A classification scheme
is a way of organizing library items into a tree (actually 
a directed acyclic graph) of classes.  Each class can have 
classes as children.  Each class has associated libitems.

This classification scheme can itself be saved in the library
and retrieved from the library as an object of type LIBCLASS.

A classification scheme can also be used to access the TPS
library using a Unix-style interface.  Use the command
UNIXLIB to enter the Unix-style top level for the library.

@IndexOther(GENERATE-CLASS-SCHEME) @i{name} @i{help}@\
Generate a classification scheme for all abbreviations,
constants, and gwffs.  TPS does some of the work, and prompts the
user to interactively make other choices.

This command can also be used to update an existing class-scheme
by including all library items which are not classified in
the existing class-scheme.

NOTE:  It is best to run this with a fresh core image.  Otherwise,
TPS may confuse items previously fetched from the library with
objects defined in the core TPS image.

@IndexOther(GOTO-CLASS) @i{name}@\

@ChapterPh(Flag Or Parameters)
The internal name of this category is 
FLAG.
A flag or parameter can be defined using DEFFLAG%.
Allowable properties are: @t{FLAGTYPE}, @t{DEFAULT}, @t{PRE-CHANGE-FN}, @t{CHANGE-FN}, @t{SUBJECTS}, @t{RELEVANCY-PRECONDITIONS}, @t{IRRELEVANCY-PRECONDITIONS}, @t{RELEVANT-KIDS}, @t{IRRELEVANT-KIDS}, @t{MHELP}.

@Section(Top Levels)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexFlag(EXT-MATE-RECOMPUTE-JFORMS)@\
If T, JForms are eagerly recomputed after modifications are made to
extensional expansion dags in the EXT-MATE top level.  Otherwise, the
user must use the command CJFORM to update the JForm.  Even if the
value is T, CJFORM is useful for obtaining special JForms where
Flex-Flex or Flexible nodes are left out.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{EXT-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{T}.

@IndexFlag(MT-DUPS-PER-QUANT)@\
The maximum number of times that each individual quantifier
may be duplicated in the MATINGSTREE search procedures. This flag is 
overridden by NUM-OF-DUPS, which governs the maximum total number of 
duplications of all quantifiers in the matingstree search.
It takes values of type INTEGER+-OR-INFINITY and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{ETREES}, @t{MTREE-TOP}.  The default value is @T{INFINITY}.

@IndexFlag(PROOFW-ACTIVE)@\
If T, active lines of the current proof are printed in the 
Current Subproof window, if this window exists.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{WINDOW-PROPS}, @t{PRINTING}, @t{OTL-VARS}.  The default value is @T{T}.

@IndexFlag(PROOFW-ACTIVE+NOS)@\
If T, active lines of the current proof are printed in the 
Current Subproof & Line Numbers window, if this window exists.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{WINDOW-PROPS}, @t{PRINTING}, @t{OTL-VARS}.  The default value is @T{T}.

@IndexFlag(PROOFW-ACTIVE+NOS-HEIGHT)@\
Controls the initial height of the Current Subproof & Line Numbers
window.
It takes values of type POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects @t{WINDOW-PROPS}, @t{OTL-VARS}.  The default value is @T{24}.

@IndexFlag(PROOFW-ACTIVE+NOS-WIDTH)@\

will force it to do the right thing, TPS will probably
do the right thing anyway).
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects @t{OUTLINE}, @t{OTL-VARS}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(TURNSTILE-INDENT)@\

indented when writing proofs in a SCRIBE file. Notice that slides use 
a different flag, SLIDES-TURNSTILE-INDENT.
This flag and TURNSTYLE-INDENT are synonymous.
It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects @t{OTL-VARS}, @t{PRINTING}, @t{PRINTING-TEX}.  The default value is @T{13}.

@IndexFlag(TURNSTILE-INDENT-AUTO)@\
Decides how turnstiles are printed in proofs. This flag works in
all styles other than TEX; in particular, it works in XTERM, GENERIC, 
SCRIBE and SLIDES styles. There are four possible settings:
FIX : put the turnstile in the column indicated by TURNSTYLE-INDENT 
      (or SLIDES-TURNSTYLE-INDENT, in style SLIDES).
MIN : print the turnstile as far to the left as possible while still having
      it in the same column on every line.  (If this puts it off the right 
      margin, then this will default to the same behaviour as FIX.)
COMPRESS : similar to VARY, but also removes spaces at other points in the
           proof (e.g. around dots, and between line numbers and hypotheses).
VARY : print the turnstile one space after the hypotheses in each line
       (so it will move from line to line).
It takes values of type INDENTATION and belongs to subjects @t{OTL-VARS}, @t{PRINTING}, @t{PRINTING-TEX}.  The default value is @T{VARY}.

The first element is the default behaviour for rewriting definitions,
and the other lists are lists of exceptions to this default, with a
different behaviour specified.
NONE:  do not rewrite this definition at all.
EAGER: rewrite all of these definitions, in one big step, as soon 
       as possible.
LAZY1: rewrite these, one step at a time, when there are no more
       EAGER rewrites to do.
DUAL: as LAZY1, but rewrite these abbreviations A to a conjunction of
       A and A, and then deepen only one of these conjuncts. (e.g.
       TRANSITIVE p becomes 
       TRANSITIVE p AND FORALL x y z . [pxy AND pyz] IMPLIES pxz
LAZY2: synonym for DUAL.

(EAGER)
would be interpreted as "Rewrite every definition in one step."

Don't ever rewrite INJECTIVE or SURJECTIVE. Rewrite every other 
definition in the DUAL way."

@IndexFlag(SKOLEM-DEFAULT)@\
Default method for skolemizing, in which wffs of the form
EXISTS y . M are replaced by M(g(...)). There are three possible ways to
do this:
SK1 is the original method due to Skolem, where the Skolem constants
 g take as arguments all the x such that FORALL x occurs in the wff 
 and EXISTS y . M is in its scope.
SK3 is the method in which the arguments of g are the free variables
 of EXISTS y . M.
NIL means don't Skolemize at all; use selection nodes instead.

an empty disjunction or an empty conjunction. this allows us to deal with 
truthvalues in formulas, especially, higher-order formulas. In order to deal 
with truthvalues in definitions, such as NULLSET, the definitions containing 
falsehood should be rewritten. Please put new definitions containing falsehood
into truthvalues-hack-updatelist so that they can be rewritten appropriately.

If DEEPEST, the default next obligation is found by depth-first
search of the obtree, if HIGHEST it is found by breadth-first-search, 
if D-SMALLEST then the deepest of the set of smallest obligations (i.e.
the set of all obligations with the fewest possible literals) is 
chosen, if H-SMALLEST then the highest of this set is chosen.
It takes values of type OBDEFAULT and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{ETREES}, @t{MTREE-TOP}.  The default value is @T{D-SMALLEST}.

@IndexFlag(MT-DEFAULT-OB-MATE)@\
Determines how ADD-CONN chooses the default obligation for
the second literal of the given pair (it is possible that this literal
will occur several times on the path, in several different obligations).
Options are:
LOWEST : Chooses the obligation which lies lowest (i.e. furthest from the
root)
HIGHEST : Chooses the obligation nearest to the root (but not the root).
HI-LO : Finds the obligation which occurs lowest; this obligation was 
first added at some point in the matingstree. Then chooses the highest 
obligation which was added at the same point in the matingstree.

@Begin(Description)
@IndexFlag(MT-SUBSUMPTION-CHECK)@\
If SAME-CONNS or T, will check whether the node about to be added is
duplicated elsewhere in the tree, and will reject it if it is. (This will use
the SAME-TAG function described below, and then do a more thorough check if the 
tags match.)

If SUBSET-CONNS, will check whether the connections at the node about to be
added are a subset of those at some other node. (This is only really useful in
MT94-11, where all possible new nodes are added, breadth-first, to the tree.
It is probably too restrictive for the other mtree searches.)

If SAME-TAG will check whether the tag (an integer generated from the list of 
connections) is the same as any other existing tag, and will reject it if it is.
See TAG-CONN-FN and TAG-LIST-FN. (Note that most tag functions can produce the
same tag for different matings, so this may reject connections unnecessarily.)

If NIL, will turn off subsumption checking altogether.
It takes values of type MT-SUBSUMPTION and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MTREE-TOP}.  The default value is @T{SAME-CONNS}.

@IndexFlag(MT94-12-TRIGGER)@\
If the current obligation contains fewer than MT94-12-TRIGGER 
literals, MT94-12 will behave in the same way as MT94-11
If it contains MT94-12-TRIGGER or more, MT94-12 will choose a literal
with as few mates as possible. There are two extrema: infinity 
means that the least branch will only be chosen if the obligation
is as big as the initial obligation; 0 means that the least branch 
will always be chosen.
It takes values of type INTEGER+-OR-INFINITY and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{ETREES}, @t{MTREE-TOP}.  The default value is @T{INFINITY}.

@IndexFlag(MTREE-FILTER-DUPS)@\
If T, will not add the same link to a mating twice on
the same branch of a matingstree during automatic search. If NIL,
will add it as many times as it wants to.

@IndexFlag(MTREE-STOP-IMMEDIATELY)@\
If T, will stop an automatic search as soon as a closed 
node is found. If NIL, will continue to generate whatever level of
the tree it was working on, and will check for closed nodes when
it finishes.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{ETREES}, @t{MTREE-TOP}.  The default value is @T{T}.

@IndexFlag(TAG-CONN-FN)@\
Determines how the tag (a number attached to each mating) is calculated.
Should be the name of a function which, given a connection, will generate an
integer from it. See MT-SUBSUMPTION-CHECK and TAG-MATING-FN.

Current settings are 
TAG-CONN-QUICK, which uses TPS's internal number for the connection. (Actually,
it uses (1 + this number), so as to avoid multiplying by one.)
TAG-CONN-LEAFNO, which multiplies the integer parts of the two leaf names
in the given connection.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects @t{MTREE-TOP}.  The default value is @T{TAG-CONN-LEAFNO}.

@IndexFlag(TAG-MATING-FN)@\
Determines how the tags for each connection are combined to produce
a tag for the entire mating.
Should be the name of a function which, given two integers, will generate a
third integer. See MT-SUBSUMPTION-CHECK and TAG-MATING-FN.

Current settings are 
MULTIPLY-TAG-LIST, which simply multiplies the numbers together.

(and may of course also be set manually).
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{MATING-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(NEW-MATING-AFTER-DUP)@\
This flag affects the way a complete mating is constructed after
    duplication.  If nil, mating search attempts to extend only those matings
    which were inextensible earlier. Otherwise, it starts constructing new
    matings.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS93-1}, @t{MS92-9}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}, @t{MS90-9}, @t{MS90-3}, @t{MS89}, @t{MS88}, @t{MATING-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(QUERY-USER)@\
Has the following effects according to its value:
T :  User will be queried by the mating search process as to whether 
  a duplication of variables should occur, unification
  depth should be increased, etc.
NIL :  The mating search process will take some action that makes sense.
QUERY-JFORMS : The mating search process will stop after printing each 
vpform and ask whether to search on this vpform or to generate another.
(Note: in MS90-3, this is pointless, since the vpform never changes.)
SHOW-JFORMS : Like QUERY-JFORMS, but automatically answers no to each 
question (and hence never actually proceeds with a search).
QUERY-SLISTS : In the TEST top level, stops after each setting of the
flags and asks whether to search with those settings.
It takes values of type QUERYTYPE and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS03-7}, @t{MS93-1}, @t{MS92-9}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}, @t{MS90-9}, @t{MS90-3}, @t{MS89}, @t{MS88}, @t{MATING-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(USE-DIY)@\
When T, proof lines which are proven by DIY, DIY-L or UNIFORM-SEARCH-L 
will not be translated into natural deduction style, but will instead be 
justified in a single step, as "Automatic" from the support lines. 
A comment will be added to the relevant line of the proof showing the
time taken and the mode used for the automatic proof.

Obviously, ND proofs containing justifications of this sort cannot be translated by
NAT-ETREE.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{OTL-VARS}, @t{TACTICS}, @t{MATING-SEARCH}, @t{ETR-NAT}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(USE-EXT-LEMMAS)@\
If this is set to T, then diy finds all positive and
negative literals which have a proper subterm of propositional,
set, or relation types.  For example, the jform may have a positive
literal P X(OA) and a negative literal P Y(OA).  For each pair
of subterms such as X and Y, extensionality lemmas of the form

    forall x [X x EQUIV Y x] implies X = Y

are added to the expansion tree before beginning mating search.
Note that the type A is determined by the types of the
subterms X and Y.

See Also:  ADD-EXT-LEMMAS
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MATING-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(USE-FAST-PROP-SEARCH)@\

theorem prover on all problems, before switching to the usual default
mating-search if this fails. If NIL, will use the default mating-search 
only.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MATING-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{T}.

@IndexFlag(MIN-QUANT-ETREE)@\
Only affects path-focused search procedures. When this flag
is T, the scope of quantifiers is minimized in primsubs appearing in
the expansion proof after searching is done and before the
propositional proof checker starts. This allows the corresponding
instantiation terms in the ND proof to be in non-prenex form, often
giving more readable proofs.

@Section(MS91-6 and MS91-7 search procedures)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexFlag(MS91-INTERLEAVE)@\
In MS91-*, primitive substitutions are generated by NAME-PRIM,
and they are applied to the master eproof before the search mechanism 
chooses particular parts of that eproof (and hence particular 
substitutions) to try and prove.

If MS91-INTERLEAVE is NIL, all of the substitutions generated by NAME-PRIM
are applied at once, and then the search mechanism chooses among them, probably
in the order in which they were generated. The process of applying them to
the eproof can take a very long time.

If MS91-INTERLEAVE is an integer n, we take n primsubs at a time for each 
variable which has primsubs, and apply only those to the eproof. Once we
have searched through those (to be specific, once we decide to generate new
options), we take the next n primsubs for each variable and apply them, 
and so on. This is much quicker, and has the advantage of not having to 
work through every primsub for the first variable before starting work on 
the next variable.

If MS91-INTERLEAVE is non-NIL, and NEW-OPTION-SET-LIMIT is greater than
MS91-INTERLEAVE * (# of vars that have primsubs), then TPS will reduce 
NEW-OPTION-SET-LIMIT. This ensures that single substitutions are 
generated before multiple substitutions.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{PRIMSUBS}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}.  The default value is @T{5}.

@IndexFlag(MS91-PREFER-SMALLER)@\
When T, smaller option-sets will be preferred to any larger ones.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}.  The default value is @T{T}.

@IndexFlag(MS91-TIME-BY-VPATHS)@\
When T, the amount of time given by SEARCH-TIME-LIMIT and 
MAX-SEARCH-LIMIT will be multiplied by the number of vertical paths
through the vpform and then divided by the number of paths through 
the initial vpform (so the first vpform will get SEARCH-TIME-LIMIT
seconds, and if the next has twice as many paths it will get twice
as many seconds, and so on...).
When NIL, every option set will get the same search time.
This flag only applies in MS91 procedures.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS91-WEIGHT-LIMIT-RANGE)@\
New option-sets, when constructed, will be accepted if their weights lie
in the range [current weight limit, current weight limit + MS91-WEIGHT-LIMIT-RANGE].
Hence increasing this value means that more option-sets will be acceptable during 
the creation stage. If this range is very small, there is a risk that no option
sets at all will be accepted and the search will waste time recreating these sets
with a higher current weight limit. If it is too large, then there is a risk that
high-weighted sets will be considered before lower-weighted ones.
Note: option sets of weight INFINITY will never be accepted, no matter what.
It takes values of type INTEGER+-OR-INFINITY and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}.  The default value is @T{1}.

@IndexFlag(NEW-OPTION-SET-LIMIT)@\
The maximum number of new option-sets that can be created at
any one time. See MS91-INTERLEAVE.

OPTIONS-GENERATE-FN. If this argument is INFINITY then new options will
never be generated. See the help message for OPTIONS-GENERATE-FN.
It takes values of type INTEGER+-OR-INFINITY and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}.  The default value is @T{75}.

@IndexFlag(OPTIONS-GENERATE-FN)@\
This is the function for deciding when to add new options
to the list from which option sets are generated. This is only called 
when new option sets are being generated, so if you are generating large
numbers of options sets at a time then you might not see an effect until
some time after your given criterion is satisfied. (Check the value of
NEW-OPTION-SETS-LIMIT if this seems to be the case.) The argument for 
this function is in the flag OPTIONS-GENERATE-ARG, and the function
to update that argument is in the flag OPTIONS-GENERATE-UPDATE.
The options are:
* ADD-OPTIONS-ORIGINAL generates new options when over 
  OPTIONS-GENERATE-ARG percent of the possible option sets have been 
  used, and each option appears in at least one option set.
* ADD-OPTIONS-COUNT generates new options when more than 
  OPTIONS-GENERATE-ARG different option sets have been tried.
* ADD-OPTIONS-WEIGHT generates new options when the lower end of the
  acceptable weight bracket for a new option set exceeds 
  OPTIONS-GENERATE-ARG.
* ADD-OPTIONS-SUBS generates new options when the number of 
  substitutions and duplications in the next option set (i.e.
  its SIMPLEST-WEIGHT-B) exceeds OPTIONS-GENERATE-ARG.
If OPTIONS-GENERATE-ARG is INFINITY, no new options are ever generated.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}.  The default value is @T{ADD-OPTIONS-ORIGINAL}.

@IndexFlag(OPTIONS-GENERATE-UPDATE)@\
The function used to update the value of the flag
OPTIONS-GENERATE-ARG. Current possibilities are:
* IDENT-ARG leaves the value unchanged.
* DOUBLE-ARG doubles the value.
* SQUARE-ARG squares the value.
* INF-ARG makes the value INFINITY.
Note that a value of INFINITY means that new options will never be 
generated.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}.  The default value is @T{IDENT-ARG}.

@IndexFlag(OPTIONS-VERBOSE)@\

@IndexFlag(PENALTY-FOR-ORDINARY-DUP)@\
Used in computing weight-b in MS91 search procedures.  Should be 
a nonnegative integer or the symbol INFINITY, and will be the amount 
of penalty given for each duplicate copy of a quantifier which is not 
used by a primitive substitution. See WEIGHT-B-FN.
It takes values of type INTEGER+-OR-INFINITY and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}.  The default value is @T{INFINITY}.

@IndexFlag(RECONSIDER-FN)@\
A function that should take a weight as argument and
return a value to be used as a new weight after the associated option set
runs out of time. Currently, the predefined functions are INF-WEIGHT 
SQUARE-WEIGHT, DOUBLE-WEIGHT and INCREMENT-WEIGHT (which, respectively,
make reconsidering an old option set impossible, very unlikely,
quite likely and probable). INCREMENT-WEIGHT actually adds 10 to the weight 
of an option set, as adding 1 is insignificant under most circumstances.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}.  The default value is @T{DOUBLE-WEIGHT}.

@IndexFlag(WEIGHT-A-COEFFICIENT)@\

@IndexFlag(WEIGHT-A-FN)@\
A function that should take an option as argument and
return a value to be used as its weight-a. Currently, the only 
such predefined function is EXPANSION-LEVEL-WEIGHT-A, which returns
the expansion level of the option to be used as a weight.
The total weight of a set of options is the weight-a of each option
plus the weight-b of the set plus the weight-c of the set.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}.  The default value is @T{EXPANSION-LEVEL-WEIGHT-A}.

@IndexFlag(WEIGHT-B-COEFFICIENT)@\
Coefficient to be used in multiplying weight-b of option/option-subset
pairs for the option-set of which we are computing weight-d. See
WEIGHT-B-FN. The total weight of a set of options is the weight-a of 
each option plus the weight-b of the set plus the weight-c of the set.
It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}.  The default value is @T{1}.

@IndexFlag(WEIGHT-B-FN)@\
A function that should take an option set and return a value 
to be used as its weight-b. Currently, the only such predefined functions are: 
* SIMPLE-WEIGHT-B-FN, which returns the sum of the penalties for the primsubs, 
  multiple subs and duplications used in the option set (see the flags 
  PENALTY-FOR-EACH-PRIMSUB, PENALTY-FOR-MULTIPLE-PRIMSUBS and  
  PENALTY-FOR-MULTIPLE-SUBS for more information),
* ALL-PENALTIES-FN which is much the same as SIMPLE-WEIGHT-B-FN but also adds
  a penalty for extra duplications given by the PENALTY-FOR-ORDINARY-DUP 
  flag, and 
* SIMPLEST-WEIGHT-B-FN, which returns 1 for the original option set and adds 
  1 for each primsub or duplication (the idea is to set the coefficients of 
  weight-a and weight-c to zero while using SIMPLEST-WEIGHT-B-FN).
The total weight of a set of options is the weight-a of each option
plus the weight-b of the set plus the weight-c of the set.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}.  The default value is @T{SIMPLEST-WEIGHT-B-FN}.

@IndexFlag(WEIGHT-C-COEFFICIENT)@\
Coefficient to be used in multiplying weight-c of options in
the option-set of which we are computing weight-d. See WEIGHT-C-FN.
The total weight of a set of options is the weight-a of each option
plus the weight-b of the set plus the weight-c of the set.
It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}.  The default value is @T{0}.

@IndexFlag(WEIGHT-C-FN)@\
A function that should take an list of options as argument and
return a value to be used as its weight-c. Currently, the only such 
predefined functions are OPTION-SET-NUM-VPATHS, which returns the number of
vertical paths through the relevant etree, and OPTION-SET-NUM-LEAVES, which 
returns the number of leaves in the relevant etree.
The total weight of a set of options is the weight-a of each option
plus the weight-b of the set plus the weight-c of the set.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}.  The default value is @T{OPTION-SET-NUM-LEAVES}.

@Section(MS98-1 search procedure)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexFlag(BREAK-AT-QUANTIFIERS)@\
Applies only to quantifiers which cannot be duplicated 
later in the search. If T, then fragments will be broken so as 
not to contain any quantifiers; if NIL, fragments may contain
quantifiers of the sort specified.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-1}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(FF-DELAY)@\
If T, delay unifying f-f pairs for single connections, and unify
them in context when some f-r pairs are added. If NIL, unify them as usual.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(HPATH-THRESHOLD)@\
If NIL, break on major conjunctions. If n, break at
conjunctions and also on disjunctions having more than n hpaths.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{1}.

@IndexFlag(MAXIMIZE-FIRST)@\
For each component which is being extended, do not create 
any new components which exceed MAX-MATES 1 until there are no other
ways to extend the component. This only works for higher-order
problems, and will be ignored in the first-order case.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MEASUREMENTS)@\
A flag set by the system to give information about
the complexity of the last problem worked on by TPS.
Should be included in the value of RECORDFLAGS
so that daterec will record the information.

Currently this records the number of vertical and horizontal paths,
number of literals, and number of acceptable connections.
It takes values of type SYMBOL-DATA-LIST and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{LIBRARY}.  The default value is @T{()}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-BASE-PRIM)@\
If T, we allow the search to begin with a fragment which is part
of a primitive substitution. If NIL, we always choose a fragment which is outside 
the primitive substitutions (if possible).
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-1}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-DUP-BELOW-PRIMSUBS)@\
When T, duplicate the quantifiers which occur below 
a primitive substitution NUM-OF-DUPS times. When NIL, don't.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-DUP-PRIMSUBS)@\
When T, MS98-DUP duplicates variables which have primsubs;
when NIL, it doesn't. (Note that duplicating the variable will
not duplicate the primsub; it will produce another copy of the 
unsubstituted-for tree below that expansion node.)
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-EXTERNAL-REWRITES)@\
When set to T, MS98-1 uses the currently active rewrite rules as
global rewrites in addition to those it extracts from the formula.
See Matt Bishop's thesis for details on rewriting in MS98-1.
If MS98-REWRITES is set to NIL, this flag is irrelevant.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{MS98-1}, @t{MATING-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-FIRST-FRAGMENT)@\
If non-NIL, this will move a single fragment to the
beginning of the literal ordering, as follows:
T : set of support strategy, more or less. The starting 
    fragment will be the last non-duplicate fragment 
    enumerated. This will be the rightmost part of the wff
    to be proven.
n : (for integer n) the starting fragment will be whichever
    fragment contains LEAFn. If this leaf is part of a duplicate
    fragment, or does not exist at all, then this will behave
    like T.

NB: This flag overrides MS98-BASE-PRIM; the chosen fragment may
always be part of a primitve substitution. 
See also MS98-FRAGMENT-ORDER.
It takes values of type SYMBOL-OR-INTEGER and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-1}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-FORCE-H-O)@\
If T, use higher-order unification graphs even for 
first-order searches. If NIL, use the normal first-order
unification.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-FRAGMENT-ORDER)@\
The order in which the fragments are considered. This
principally affects which fragment will become the starting 
point of the search, and which of the touched but not blocked
fragments will be blocked next. See also MS98-FIRST-FRAGMENT.
0 : consider the number of ways to block the given fragment.
1 : consider the number of ways that the results for 0 might be
    extended (i.e. look ahead two steps in the search process)
2 : as for 1, but then weight in favour of ground fragments
    (i.e. those containing no variables).
It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-1}.  The default value is @T{1}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-INIT)@\
Before doing ms98-1 search:
If 0, do nothing at first; after each failure, duplicate one more quantifier.
If 1, duplicate all outer quantifiers NUM-OF-DUPS times.
If 2, apply primsubs and duplicate all outer quantifiers NUM-OF-DUPS times.
If 3, cycle through primsubs one at a time, and duplicate all outer
      quantifiers NUM-OF-DUPS times. The time spent on each primsub will
      be at least MAX-SEARCH-LIMIT seconds, unless the search fails before
      then.
It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-1}.  The default value is @T{0}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-LOW-MEMORY)@\
If T, try to keep memory use low. This will probably
make the search take longer.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-MAX-COMPONENTS)@\
If non-NIL, the maximum number of components that can be 
considered on any iteration of the MS98 search.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-MAX-PRIMS)@\
The maximum number of primsubs allowed in any component.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-1}.  The default value is @T{1}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-MEASURE)@\
Determines the measure which is used on components.
If 0, count the components blocked and then weight heavily against 
      the situation described by MS98-VALID-PAIR.
If 1, the standard measure using the # of components blocked and touched
If 2, as for 1 but also take account of the number of dups
If 3, just count the number of components blocked
If 4, as for 2 but also count the no of matings for the smallest 
      component touched
If 5, multiply the no of matings for the smallest touched by the 
      number of subs.
If 6, use the ratio of blocked to touched components and the ratio
      of the number of blocked components to the number of connections.
If 7, prefer matings where positive leaves are mated to negative leaves
      and vice versa.
If 8, use the ratio of blocked to touched components.
If 9, favour large components satisfying max-mates 1.
If 10, do as for 9 and then weight heavily against 
      the situation described by MS98-VALID-PAIR.
If 11, do as for 6 and then weight heavily against 
      the situation described by MS98-VALID-PAIR.
If 12, do as for 8 and then weight heavily against 
      the situation described by MS98-VALID-PAIR.
If 13, weight in favour of components with max-mates 1 and then 
      weight heavily against the situation described by MS98-VALID-PAIR.
If 14, do as for 7 and then weight heavily against 
      the situation described by MS98-VALID-PAIR.
If 15, take the average of 11 and 14.
It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-1}.  The default value is @T{0}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-MERGE-DAGS)@\
For higher-order searches only. Affects the way in 
which the unification graphs of elementary components are 
computed.
0 : Check that the graphs of the connections are pairwise
    compatible. Only compute the full graph of a component
    when necessary.
1 : Check that the graphs of the connections are compatible
    taken all together. (This can take a while for large
    sets of connections.) Only compute the full graph when 
    necessary.
2 : Always compute the full graph. This overrides FF-DELAY.
It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{0}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-MINIMALITY-CHECK)@\
If T, check each new component for minimality and reject 
those which are non-minimal. If NIL, don't bother.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-NUM-OF-DUPS)@\
If NIL, we can use every duplication that's present.
If some positive integer n, we reject any component using more than n 
of the duplications.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-1}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-POLLUTE-GLOBAL-REWRITES)@\
When set to T, rewrites generated by MS98-1 are not removed from
the list of global rewrite rules after the search is complete.
See Matt Bishop's thesis for details on rewriting in MS98-1.
If MS98-REWRITES is set to NIL, this flag is irrelevant.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{MS98-1}, @t{MATING-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-PRIMSUB-COUNT)@\
The maximum number of primsubs to be applied each
set variable in the expansion tree.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-1}.  The default value is @T{3}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-REW-PRIMSUBS)@\
When T, MS98-DUP does primsubs for Leibniz variables which 
have become rewrites; when NIL, it doesn't.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-REWRITE-DEPTH)@\
When attempting to rewrite one term into another,
the maximum number of steps of rewriting that are allowed.
It takes values of type POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-1}.  The default value is @T{2}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-REWRITE-MODEL)@\
If T, ask the user for a model of the rewrite rules
to help slim down the unification tree.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-REWRITE-PRUNE)@\
If T, delete any unifiers which are duplicates modulo
rewriting (this can be slow). If NIL, don't.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{T}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-REWRITE-SIZE)@\
The maximum size of a (lambda-normalized) term that can be 
produced by rewriting, measured as the number of nodes in the parse
tree of that term. NIL means that there is no maximum.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-1}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-REWRITE-UNIF)@\
When a rewrite rule can introduce a new variable, this
flag governs the size of the allowed substitutions for that
variable. Essentially, this is a special case of MAX-SUBSTS-VAR.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-1}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-REWRITES)@\
When T, make all of the global equalities into rewrites.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-1}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-TRACE)@\
Given a mating in advance, this is used to trace the progress 
of MS98-1 search for a mating.  This is a list of symbols which
indicate what to trace.  The possible symbols are:

1. MATING - Search as usual, keeping a record of when good connections and
components are formed.  The value of *ms98-trace-file* is a string giving the
name of a file into which this information is stored.
2. MATING-FILTER - The search is filtered to only consider good
connections and components.  This is useful for a quick check
if the search can possibly succeed.  Typically, when MATING-FILTER
is on the list, then so is MATING.

If the list is nonempty at all, then the trace is considered 'on'.
The consequence of this is that duplications and primsubs are
skipped at the beginning of search, and that the output of the
trace will be sent to the file indicated by the global variable
*ms98-trace-file*.
It takes values of type SYMBOLLIST and belongs to subjects @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{()}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-UNIF-HACK)@\
If T, do not introduce new constants during unification.
(NOTE: This is a hack; we *do* need to introduce new constants, in 
general, but in most cases we needn't bother.)
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-UNIF-HACK2)@\
If T, during the generation of unifiers, prevent the 
occurrence of subformulas of type o which contain no variables
(except for TRUTH and FALSEHOOD, if they are allowed by MS98-UNIF-HACK).
If NIL, allow these to be generated.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-USE-COLORS)@\
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-1}.  The default value is @T{T}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-VALID-PAIR)@\
Given two disjuncts X OR Y and A OR B, this flag 
determines when we are allowed to make a component containing 
connections X-A and Y-B (assuming they're unifiable connections).
The higher the number, the more stringent (and more time-consuming)
the test; any correct mating is guaranteed to pass any of these tests:
1: MAX-MATES is not 1.
2: As for 1, plus we require an extra mate for each of X,Y,A and B.
3: As for 2, plus we require that all of these new mates be 
   pairwise compatible with each other.
4: As for 3, plus we require that all of these new mates be 
   simultaneously compatible with each other.

3 and 4 are only applicable to higher-order searches.

There is an extra value, 0, which rejects any such connections
even if max-mates is not 1. This results in an incomplete search,
but is often acceptable.
It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{1}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-VARIABLE-ORDER)@\
Determines the variable ordering for the unification
graph. Only affects higher-order searches.
Suppose N is the maximum number of unifiers for a 
given list of variables, and K is the length of the list.
For values 0--3, the variables are first grouped into lists of duplicate
copies (so each variable is listed with its duplicates, if any)
0 : Sort by N, largest first.
1 : Sort by N, smallest first.
2 : Sort by K, largest first.
3 : Sort by K, smallest first.
10--13 : Group the variables into lists of length 1, and then proceed
as 0--3.
20--23 : Group the variables into lists that occur together (i.e. two
variables go into the same list if their expansion nodes are not separated 
by any junctive node in the etree) and then proceed as for 0--3.
30--33 : Group the variables as for 0--3, and then reduce the lists 
to length 1 while keeping the variables in the same order.
40--43 : Group the variables as for 20--23, and then reduce the lists 
to length 1 while keeping the variables in the same order.
Other values X will behave like (X div 10) for variable grouping and
(X mod 10) for ordering the groups.
It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is @T{1}.

@IndexFlag(MS98-VERBOSE)@\
If T, print extra information during MS98-1 search.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-1}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.
@End(Description)

@Section(Extensional Search)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexFlag(EXT-SEARCH-LIMIT)@\
If EXT-SEARCH-LIMIT is an integer which will place a limit on the extensional search
procedure MS03-7.  Given such a limit, search is incomplete and guaranteed to eventually terminate.
If EXT-SEARCH-LIMIT is set to infinity, then the search may not terminate.
It takes values of type INTEGER+-OR-INFINITY and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS03-7}, @t{EXT-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{INFINITY}.

@IndexFlag(MS03-DUP-METHOD)@\
The method by which different duplication options are considered
by the MS03-7 search procedure.

1.  Simply add the oldest expansion arc that has not been considered yet
(and any arcs related to it) each time a new option is tried.
This will lead to extremely large jforms in most cases.

2.  Works like 1 except with respect to expansion arcs that either
contain a nontrivial set substitution (ie, one with logical connectives)
or are associated with a set existence lemma.  With respect to these
'set expansion arcs', we remove whatever such arcs are in the current
option and replace them with a new set expansion arc (thus considering
a new set expansion option).  If every single set expansion option
has been considered, we begin considering two at a time, and so on.

3.  Works like 2 except we treat every expansion of set type
as a set expansion arc instead of just the ones with nontrivial
set substitutions.

See Also: MS03-WEIGHT-CHANGE-DUPS, MAX-SEARCH-LIMIT
It takes values of type POSNUMBER and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS03-7}, @t{EXT-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{1}.

@IndexFlag(MS03-QUICK-EUNIFICATION-LIMIT)@\
This provides a bound on how much E-unification MS03-7 and MS04-2 attempt to do
before deciding what to mate.
It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS04-2}, @t{MS03-7}, @t{EXT-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{50}.

@IndexFlag(MS03-SOLVE-RIGID-PARTS)@\
If T, MS03-7 tries to find quick solutions to the rigid parts of a
problem.  This only applies when MS03-USE-JFORMS is T.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS03-7}, @t{EXT-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{T}.

@IndexFlag(MS03-SOLVE-RIGID-PARTS-ALLOW-RECONNECTS)@\
When trying to solve the rigid part of a jform,
we might consider connecting two literals that are already connected.
Sometimes this speeds up the search, presumably by keeping
us from looking at possible connections beneath connections (needed to show
equivalences).
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS03-7}, @t{EXT-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{T}.

@IndexFlag(MS03-USE-JFORMS)@\
If T, MS03-7 uses (dissolved) jforms during search.
Constructing and dissolving jforms can be time consuming, but in
principle can restrict the branching of search.  If NIL, jforms
are not used, which may result in the consideration of connections
which only span paths already spanned by other connections.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS03-7}, @t{EXT-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{T}.

@IndexFlag(MS03-USE-SET-CONSTRAINTS)@\
If this flag and MS03-USE-JFORMS are T,
MS03-7 uses set constraints in addition to primsubs 
to determine potential set substitutions.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{PRIMSUBS}, @t{MS03-7}, @t{EXT-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MS03-VERBOSE)@\

getting around using a banned selected variable (using duplication or
equational reasoning).
It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}, @t{MS04-2}, @t{MS03-7}, @t{EXT-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{300}.

@IndexFlag(MS03-WEIGHT-CHANGE-DUPS)@\
If MAX-SEARCH-LIMIT is NIL, then MS03-WEIGHT-CHANGE-DUPS controls
how often MS03-7 changes which expansion terms are considered.

@IndexFlag(MS03-WEIGHT-DISJ-EUNIF)@\
When attempting to E-unify two literals a and b, this weight is
multiplied by disjdepth(a) * disjdepth(b) where disjdepth of a literal
is the number of disjunctions above the literal on the jform.
The effect of this is to prefer mating nodes that are closer to being 'global'.

If MS03-USE-JFORMS is set to NIL, the disjdepth of a node is
measured by the number of disjunctive nodes above the node in the edag.
This measure is less precise, since dissolution isn't used.

See Also: MS03-WEIGHT-DISJ-MATE, MS03-WEIGHT-DISJ-UNIF
It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS03-7}, @t{EXT-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{10}.

@IndexFlag(MS03-WEIGHT-DISJ-MATE)@\
When attempting to mate two literals a and b, this weight is
multiplied by disjdepth(a) * disjdepth(b) where disjdepth of a literal
is the number of disjunctions above the literal on the jform.
The effect of this is to prefer mating nodes that are closer to being 'global'.

If MS03-USE-JFORMS is set to NIL, the disjdepth of a node is
measured by the number of disjunctive nodes above the node in the edag.
This measure is less precise, since dissolution isn't used.

It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS03-7}, @t{EXT-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{10}.

@IndexFlag(MS03-WEIGHT-DISJ-UNIF)@\
When performing a unification (imitation or projection) step
on a negative equation literal, this value is multiplied by the
disjdepth of the literal.  The disjdepth is the number of disjunctions
above the literal in the jform.

If MS03-USE-JFORMS is set to NIL, the disjdepth of the negative equation
node is measured by the number of disjunctive nodes above the node in the edag.

ETREE-NAT.
It takes values of type PRINT-FUNCTION-LIST and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{WINDOW-PROPS}, @t{PRINTING}, @t{ETR-NAT}.  The default value is @T{(PRFW-PALL PRFW-^P PRFW-^PN ^PN)}.

@IndexFlag(MATINGSTREE-NAME)@\
Prefix for labels associated with nodes in a matingstree.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects @t{ETREES}, @t{MTREE-TOP}.  The default value is @T{MSTREE}.

@IndexFlag(MERGE-MINIMIZE-MATING)@\
If T, merging will attempt to minimize the mating
by removing any unnecessary connections. If NIL, it won't.
T will sometimes produce a more readable ND proof, but can
also take a very long time.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-1}, @t{MS93-1}, @t{MS92-9}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}, @t{MS90-9}, @t{MS90-3}, @t{MS89}, @t{MS88}, @t{ETR-NAT}, @t{ETREES}, @t{MATING-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{T}.

@IndexFlag(NAT-ETREE-VERSION)@\
Determines which version of NAT-ETREE to use:
OLD -- The original version.
HX  -- Hongwei Xi's version which is intended to work on
       any natural deduction proof, normal or not.  This
       version has problems, but might work.
CEB -- Which is intended to only work on normal proofs,
       and should in principle always work on normal proofs.
It takes values of type NAT-ETREE-VERSION-TYPE and belongs to subjects @t{ETR-NAT}.  The default value is @T{CEB}.

@IndexFlag(NATREE-DEBUG)@\
To invoke the debugging facilities mentioned in the Programmers
Guide associated with NAT-ETREE. If NATREE-VERSION is set to CEB and
NATREE-DEBUG is set to T, then the code doublechecks that a mating exists,
giving the user lots of information.  This should eventually evolve into
a flag with more choices.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{MS93-1}, @t{MS92-9}, @t{MS88}, @t{MS89}, @t{MS91-6}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS90-9}, @t{MS90-3}, @t{MATING-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(REMOVE-LEIBNIZ)@\

@End(Description)

@Section(Unification)

@Begin(Description)
@IndexFlag(APPLY-MATCH)@\
Heuristic to decide the pair that should be given to match.
UN88 procedures:
APPLY-MATCH-ALL-FRDPAIRS applies match to all flexible-rigid pairs 
   and chooses whichever will have fewest substitutions.
APPLY-MATCH-ALL-FRDPAIRS-MSV does the same, but also checks for
   MAX-SUBSTS-VAR violations at the same time.
APPLY-MATCH-MAX-SUBSTS applies match to whichever flexible-rigid
   pair is closest to exceeding the bound in MAX-SUBSTS-VAR.
   If it finds one with a unique substitution, it uses that.
APPLY-MATCH-MIN-SUBSTS is like the above, but chooses the pair
   which is farthest from the MAX-SUBSTS-VAR bound.
APPLY-MATCH-MOST-CONSTS applies match to whichever flex-rigid
   pair contains the most constant symbols.
(The last two of these are all but useless; both of the SUBSTS
versions will be disastrous if MAX-SUBSTS-VAR is NIL...)

UN90 procedures:
This flag is almost always ignored (the default behaviour is
much like APPLY-MATCH-ALL-FRDPAIRS, but see NUM-FRPAIRS and
COUNTSUBS-FIRST for more details). The exception is if it is
APPLY-MATCH-MAX-SUBSTS, in which case it will go for whichever
pair is closest to exceeding the MAX-SUBSTS-VAR bound (but will
still use NUM-FRPAIRS and COUNTSUBS-FIRST).
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{APPLY-MATCH-ALL-FRDPAIRS}.

@IndexFlag(COUNTSUBS-FIRST)@\
if NIL, the substitutions which MATCH generates for each dpair in the
unification process are generated and counted, and then MATCH is
actually applied to the variable for which this number is smallest; if
T, the substitutions are counted before they are generated, and only
those which will be applied are actually generated.
Applies to UN90 only.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(DNEG-IMITATION)@\
Determine when to produce imitation terms that contain
double negations. Only applies in UN88 when REDUCE-DOUBLE-NEG is T
(in UN88 otherwise, it is implicitly set to ALWAYS; in UN90 it is
implicitly set to CONST-FLEX).
When TPS mates two flexible literals f and g, it adds (f . ~g) as
a dpair. Because it may really have needed (g . ~f), we allow 
imitation terms to contain double negations even if REDUCE-DOUBLE-NEG
is T. The options are as follows:
ALWAYS always allows double negations to be used.
CONST forbids them for dpairs of the form (f . ~G), where G is a
  constant, but allows them otherwise.
FLEX forbids them for (f . ~g) if g was created by a double negation
  in the first place (this prevents endless cycles), but allows them
  otherwise.
CONST-FLEX forbids them in the two cases for CONST and FLEX, but allows
  them otherwise.
NEVER forbids them outright.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{CONST-FLEX}.

@IndexFlag(ETA-RULE)@\
If T, eta rule is permitted in the unification package.
This can be T or NIL for the UN88 procedure, but it can only be
T for the UN90 procedure. (In fact, UN90 ignores this flag.)
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{T}.

@IndexFlag(IMITATION-FIRST)@\
Controls whether imitations are considered before projections during
unification procedure UN88. No effect in UN90.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{T}.

@IndexFlag(LEIBNIZ-SUB-CHECK)@\
When T, check substitutions which are made for Leibniz
variables, to ensure that they are relevant in their first argument.
When NIL, don't do this.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MAX-DUP-PATHS)@\
Any universal jform which has more than MAX-DUP-PATHS paths below it cannot get
duplicated during search process.
It takes values of type INTEGER+-OR-INFINITY and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS93-1}, @t{MS92-9}, @t{MS88}, @t{MS89}, @t{MS91-6}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS90-9}, @t{MS90-3}, @t{MATING-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{INFINITY}.

@IndexFlag(MAX-SEARCH-DEPTH)@\
If non nil, search to depth MAX-SEARCH-DEPTH, else search to
arbitrary depth. Takes precedence over all other flags that may 
control the search depth in a unification tree (i.e. no tree is ever
generated to a greater depth, although other flags may cause the 
unification search to stop temporarily at a shallower depth. Used 
in all search procedures, and in UN88 and UN90. 
See flag MAX-UTREE-DEPTH also.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{IMPORTANT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(MAX-UTREE-DEPTH)@\
If non-NIL, maximum depth to which unification tree is to be 
generated. Used only in UN88 procedures. This variable is incremented 
during mating-search to allow unification tree to grow to 
greater depth as the search progresses. The unification tree
is, however, never searched or generated to a depth greater than
MAX-SEARCH-DEPTH provided it is non NIL and a positive integer. One can
also consider this variable to be the initial value to which unification
trees are generated during mating-search.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{IMPORTANT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{5}.

@IndexFlag(MIN-QUICK-DEPTH)@\
The minimum depth to which a unification tree should be generated
when unification tree is searched only to non branching depth. Setting this
flag to 1 has the effect of generating the tree to non branching depth.
Applicable only to UN88.
MIN-QUICK-DEPTH is used only in the process of checking whether two
literals are potential mates. It is used to construct the connection graph.
See flag MAX-SEARCH-DEPTH also.
See MAX-SUBSTS-QUICK for a different way to achieve a similar effect.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{3}.

@IndexFlag(MS-DIR)@\
The director to be used in mating search.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS91-6}, @t{MS89}, @t{MS88}, @t{MATING-SEARCH}.  The default value is @T{QUASI-TPS1}.

@IndexFlag(MS90-3-QUICK)@\
If T, do MS88 quick unification on dpairs in MS90-3.
If NIL, don't.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}, @t{MS92-9}, @t{MS93-1}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS90-9}, @t{MS90-3}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(PRUNING)@\
If T, the unification routine will prune the tree as it goes.
Only works for BREADTH-FIRST and BEST-FIRST unification, and
only then in MS88.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(REDUCE-DOUBLE-NEG)@\
If T double negations are eliminated during lambda contraction
at a unification node. This only applies in UN88.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{T}.

@IndexFlag(RIGID-PATH-CK)@\
If T, apply rigid-path checking when doing unification. If NIL, 
switch to original unification. Both UN90 and UN88 unification 
procedures are affected by the flag.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS93-1}, @t{MS92-9}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}, @t{MS90-9}, @t{MS90-3}, @t{MS89}, @t{MS88}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{T}.

@IndexFlag(STOP-AT-TSN)@\
If T the unification algorithm terminates at a terminal success 
node. Otherwise, it continues generating the tree.
This only applies to UN88.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{T}.

@IndexFlag(SUBSUMPTION-CHECK)@\
Limited subsumption check should be done during unification when
this flag is set. Applies for procedures UN88 and UN90, although it is
much more useful in UN88 (UN90 does not generate as many subsumed nodes,
and so subsumption-checking tends to be a waste of time). 
See also SUBSUMPTION-NODES and SUBSUMPTION-DEPTH.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(SUBSUMPTION-DEPTH)@\
Subsumption checking takes a lot of time, compared 
to unification, which means that checking a new node may
take more time than it could possibly save, particularly
if the node is almost at the maximum depth for the 
unification tree.
In the unification tree, new nodes at depth SUBSUMPTION-DEPTH
or deeper will not be subsumption-checked; other new nodes
will be. Having SUBSUMPTION-DEPTH INFINITY means that all new 
nodes are subsumption-checked; SUBSUMPTION-DEPTH 0 is just
a slower way of turning subsumption-checking off altogether.
(You should use SUBSUMPTION-CHECK NIL to do that!)
This flag only applies when SUBSUMPTION-CHECK is T.
See also SUBSUMPTION-NODES.
It takes values of type INTEGER+-OR-INFINITY and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{INFINITY}.

@IndexFlag(SUBSUMPTION-NODES)@\
When SUBSUMPTION-CHECK is T, this flag determines
which other nodes should be examined to see if they subsume the
new node being considered. The values are as follows, arranged
in order with the quickest first:
PATH-NODES checks only those nodes on the path from the root to
  the new node.
LEAF-NODES checks only the leaf nodes in the tree.
LP-NODES checks leaf nodes and those on the path to the
  new node.
ALL-NODES checks every node in the tree.
Some nodes will always be excluded from subsumption checking,
regardless of the value of this flag. In particular, two nodes
representing different sets of connections will not be 
compared. 
This flag only applies to the UN88 procedure; in UN90, if
subsumption-checking is used at all, it is implicitly
set to ALL-NODES.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{LP-NODES}.

@IndexFlag(TOTAL-NUM-OF-DUPS)@\
Max number of duplications allowed at any time 
during a search using path-focused duplication. Compare
NUM-OF-DUPS. This flag will be ignored if set to NIL.
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS IS BUGGY; setting it to NIL is safest.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS90-3}, @t{MATING-SEARCH}, @t{IMPORTANT}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(UNI-SEARCH-HEURISTIC)@\
Search strategy used to select the next node in the unification tree.
BREADTH-FIRST and DEPTH-FIRST are exactly as they sound;
BEST-FIRST takes whichever leaf node has the fewest free
variables (and is not already terminal).
All of these options work for UN90 (ms90-*, ms91-7, ms92-*);
BREADTH-FIRST and BEST-FIRST are the only options for UN88 (ms88, ms89, 
ms91-6, mtree).
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{BREADTH-FIRST}.

@IndexFlag(UNIF-COUNTER)@\
If this flag is non-zero, PP* will be called to 
print out information about the current unification tree at 
regular intervals. This flag determines the length of
the intervals, measured by the number of calls to the
unification procedure. The amount of information is
determined by the setting of UNIF-COUNTER-OUTPUT.
If the flag is set to 0, this feature will be turned off.
This flag only applies in UN88 unification.
It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{0}.

@IndexFlag(UNIF-COUNTER-OUTPUT)@\
See UNIF-COUNTER and UNIF-TRIGGER for the use of this flag.
Settings are:
0: Print the entire tree in flat format with details. (PALL)
1: Print the entire tree in flat format without details. (PALL)
2: Print the tree in tree format with subs. (UTREE*)
3: Print the tree in tree format without subs. (UTREE*)
4: Print just the subs and details in flat format. (UTREE)
5: Print just the subs in flat format. (UTREE)
6: Print full details of the last node. (P and PP*)
7: Print some details of the last node. (P and PP)
8: Print the last node and its properties only.
9: Print the statistics for the tree so far. (STATS)
10: Print the average values for STATS, after a mating is found.
This flag only applies in UN88 unification.
It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{0}.

@IndexFlag(UNIF-TRIGGER)@\
If this flag is non-NIL, PP* will be called to 
print out information about the current unification tree 
after certain events (compare UNIF-COUNTER).
Settings are:
NIL: Print nothing.
UTREE-END: Printout whenever a tree has come to an end
  (either failure or success; NB UNIF-COUNTER-OUTPUT 6 or 7
   will not work with this setting.)
UTREE-END1: As UTREE-END, but also gives output when quick
  unification ends a tree without completing it.
UTREE-BEGIN: Printout the root node when unification is
  first called.
PROPS-CHANGE: Printout whenever the properties of a node 
  are different from those of its parent. (Best used with
  UNIF-COUNTER-OUTPUT 6 or 7.) 
The amount of information is determined by the setting of 
UNIF-COUNTER-OUTPUT. If the flag is set to NIL, this 
feature will be turned off.
This flag only applies in UN88 unification.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(UNIFY-VERBOSE)@\
Takes values SILENT=NIL, MIN, MED or MAX=T, and governs the amount
of output relating to the unification process.
It takes values of type VERBOSE and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS93-1}, @t{MS92-9}, @t{MS91-7}, @t{MS91-6}, @t{MS90-9}, @t{MS90-3}, @t{MS89}, @t{MS88}, @t{MATING-SEARCH}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{MED}.

the previous attempt as arguments, and should set the flags in the list
appropriately for the next search. This function should also return T in
*finished-flag* if all settings have been tried.
The only values defined so far are:
EXHAUSTIVE-SEARCH, which tries all combinations of flags in a searchlist, 
 varying one flag through its entire range before trying the next flag.
BREADTH-FIRST-SEARCH, which also tries all combinations of flags, but 
 varies each flag a little at a time.
PRESS-DOWN, which is used by the PRESS-DOWN command.
PRESS-DOWN-2, which behaves like breadth-first search except that if varying
 a flag makes the search faster, that flag is then prevented
 from returning above its original value (the range of each flag is 
 assumed to be ordered; if the range is (A B C D), and setting it to
 C results in a faster search, it will never again be set to A or B).
PUSH-UP, which is used by the PUSH-UP command.
PUSH-UP-2, which is like breadth-first search but terminates once a 
 successful mode is discovered; it is used for relaxing an unsuccessful
 mode until it is successful.

which is over 4 billion.  Consequently, the value of this flag should
not be changed until TPS is either considering models other than
standard models based on powers of 2 or computing power increases
tremendously.

@IndexFlag(REN-VAR-FN)@\
The value of this flag is a function to be called when a variable
must be renamed automatically. It has three possible settings:
REN-VAR-X1 is the standard renaming function. It renames y to y^1,
 then to y^2, and so on. If there is another variable y, of a different 
 type, it makes no difference.
REN-VAR-X11 is much like REN-VAR-X1, except it will avoid creating
 two variables of the same name at different types (so it tends to 
 produce higher exponents than REN-VAR-X1).
REN-VAR-XA renames alphabetically, turning y into ya, then yba, 
 and so on.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects @t{WFF-PRIMS}.  The default value is @T{REN-VAR-X1}.

@IndexFlag(RENAME-ALL-BD-VARS)@\

@IndexFlag(REWRITE-EQUALITIES)@\
One of the following:
NONE: do not rewrite equalities
ONLY-EXT: rewrite only those equalities that can be rewritten using
          extensionality.
LEIBNIZ: rewrite all equalities using the Leibniz definition.
ALL: rewrite all equalities, to an equivalence for those of type OOO,
     to the extensional form 
      [lambda f(AB) lambda g(AB) forall x(B) f x = g x]
     for those of type O(AB)(AB), and to the Leibniz form
      [lambda x(A) lambda y(A) forall q(OA). q x implies q y]
     for those of type OAA.
LAZY2: As for ALL, but keeping a duplicate leaf as in the LAZY2
       setting of the flag REWRITE-DEFNS.
PARITY1: Uses the parity to determine whether equalities should be
    rewritten as the setting LEIBNIZ or as the setting ALL.  For example,
    using PARITY1 when trying to prove the wff 
              A(OI) = B(OI) implies C
    the equality is expaned using Leibniz, and when trying to prove the wff
              D implies A(OI) = B(OI)
    the equality is expanded using extensionality.  The heuristic
    is that we often use the substitutivity property when we use an equation
    and use extensionality to show an equation.

This flag is used by the command TPS-TEST, and can be set automatically by
the command TEST-INIT.

The default setting is a sample list of two standard TPS exercises, both 
to be run in mode ML (also standard in TPS). If you set this flag yourself,
beware of unexported symbols --- which is to say, make sure that the 
symbols you use are all in the USER package (this is particularly 
necessary if you are using library theorems which are not yet loaded
into TPS, or they may end up interned in the wrong package). If in doubt,
put "USER::" before all symbols, thus:

(setq test-theorems '((cl-user::thm30 . cl-user::mode-thm30) (cl-user::x2112 . cl-user::ml)))

You can use the flag TEST-MODIFY to alter modes on the fly as TPS-TEST runs.

@IndexFlag(MAX-SUBSTS-QUICK)@\
When NIL, quick unification is governed by the MIN-QUICK-DEPTH
flag, and only minimal amounts of MAX-SUBSTS checking are done during 
quick unification.
When MIN-SUBSTS-QUICK is a positive integer, quick unification 
(i.e. partial unification of a possible connection) is considered as a 
special case of normal unification, with MAX-SUBSTS-VAR temporarily 
equal to the value of MAX-SUBSTS-QUICK.
When MIN-SUBSTS-QUICK is 0, quick unification goes down as far as it can 
until it is forced to either branch or violate MAX-SUBSTS-VAR. (This is 
almost equivalent to MAX-SUBSTS-QUICK NIL and MIN-QUICK-DEPTH 1.) 

Note: non-NIL values of MAX-SUBSTS-QUICK only take effect if MAX-SUBSTS-VAR
is also non-NIL. In this case, other flags will also be affected, as follows:
APPLY-MATCH will be ignored (the matching routine that is used will be a 
variant of APPLY-MATCH-ALL-FRDPAIRS)
COUNTSUBS-FIRST and STOP-AT-TSN will be T.
SUBSUMPTION-CHECK, UNIF-COUNTER and UNIF-TRIGGER will be NIL.
UNI-SEARCH-HEURISTIC will be BREADTH-FIRST.
MIN-QUICK-DEPTH and MAX-UTREE-DEPTH will be ignored.

@IndexFlag(MAX-SUBSTS-VAR)@\
The maximum number of substitutions allowed for any given
free variable in a dpairset. This is cumulative (i.e. if an old 
variable f is replaced by h1, which is in turn replaced by h2,
that counts as two substitutions for f). Only projections or
imitations are counted; eliminating substitutions are not.
See also MAX-SUBSTS-PROJ and MAX-SUBSTS-PROJ-TOTAL.
This applies to higher-order unification (UN88 or UN90) only.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-INTEGER and belongs to subjects @t{TRANSMIT}, @t{MS98-1}, @t{IMPORTANT}, @t{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is @T{NIL}.

@IndexFlag(PRIMSUB-VAR-SELECT)@\
If T, primsubs will only be applied to those variables
which occur both negatively and positively as the head variable
of some leaves in the current eproof.
If NIL, primsubs will be applied to any variable which occurs
either negatively or positively or both, anywhere
