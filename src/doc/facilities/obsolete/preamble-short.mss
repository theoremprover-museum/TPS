@ChapterPh(Introduction)
This document is a short version of the TPS3 Facilities Guide, and 
lists @TPS commands, flags, etc.,  excluding those categories which
are not useful to the general user.
Each chapter lists the members of a @TPS category; each chapter is further
divided into sections, which group those members of the category by
the context in which they were defined.  A Table of Contents may be
found at the end of this document.

After each command is listed the arguments it takes (if any).  Note that
these arguments are not argument types, but rather descriptive identifiers
intended to convey the role each argument is playing in the command 
invocation.  The argument types for each command may be obtained by
consulting the on-line documentation.

This document is generated automatically by @TPS using the @t(SCRIBE-DOC)
command and, when produced, accurately reflects the current state of
the system. All documentation listed in this guide is also available on-line.
To produce this document, load the file @t(facilities-short.lisp)@foot(All
files referred to in this chapter are located on the directory
doc/facilities.)
into @TPS. The system will produce the scribe file @t(facilities-short.mss).
You should now run the file @t(manual-short.mss) through scribe, and print the
resulting @t(manual-short.{press,PS}) file.
