@Section(Quick Reference to Rules)
Here is a list of the most generally useful rules of inference
available in @ETPS for quick reference. Some additional  rules of
inference may be found by typing "?" or "@t(LIST-RULES)"
in @ETPS.
See the page indicated for a precise description of each rule listed below.
You can also type "@t(HELP) @I(rule)" in @ETPS.
The rules of inference in @ETPS are applicable to both first-order logic
and higher-order logic. The user who is interested only in first-order
logic should ignore the rules for higher-order logic.
