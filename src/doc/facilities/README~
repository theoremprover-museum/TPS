# SCRIBE DOCUMENTATION:
# The files in this directory can be used to generate a listing of the current
# commands, flags, inference rules, abbreviations, etc. in TPS.  To get the
# listing, load the file scribe-facilities.lisp (for a long and pretty comprehensive
# version) or scribe-facilities-short.lisp (for a shorter version which basically
# includes only commands and flags that an everyday user would care about).
# Part of the lisp function in these files specifies the output file; EDITn
# THAT PATHNAME to put the file into the facilities directory.
# 
# Note: If you a tps3 core image into which you have already loaded
# certain wffs from your library, these will show up in the facilities
# guide.
# 
# tload "/home/theorem/project/doc/facilities/scribe-facilities.lisp"
# or
# tload "/home/theorem/project/doc/facilities/scribe-facilities-short.lisp"
# 
# Compile file /home/theorem/project/doc/facilities/scribe-facilities.lisp?>n
# 
# Then do:
# % cd doc/facilities
# % scribe scribe-manual 
# 
# or, if you used facilities-short.lisp,
# 
# % scribe scribe-manual-short
# 
# See the end of the User's Guide for a more complete discussion.
# 
# The facilities-cmd.lisp and manual-cmd.mss files are intended to produce
# a manual which contains only commands and flags (i.e. the short facilities guide
# without information on tactics, tacticals, binders, abbreviations, types, 
# subjects, modes, events, styles etc). It also omits grader commands, and prints with 
# narrower page margins. To produce this manual, replace "-short"
# with "-cmd" in the above. At the time of writing, scribe-manual-cmd.mss ran to 90 pages,
# scribe-manual-short.mss was 156 pages, and scribe-manual.mss was 246 pages.
# 
# If you want a very short manual containing just a little information,
# (such as a summary of a new search procedure) use facilities-temp. Edit
# facilities-temp.lisp to contain just the categories you wish, and
# FLAG. In TPS
# tload "/home/theorem/project/doc/facilities/scribe-facilities-temp.lisp"
# Then edit /home/theorem/project/doc/facilities/scribe-facilities-temp.mss
# to eliminate all the flags you do not want in this manual, and 
# scribe the file.
# 
# Since there are now gzipped versions for the Web, you can run this README file
# as a script to gzip the postscript file and create a pdf file:
cp scribe-manual.ps  scribe-man.ps
gzip scribe-man.ps
ps2pdf scribe-manual.ps

# and the equivalent with manual-short:
cp  scribe-manual-short.ps  scribe-mans.ps
gzip  scribe-mans.ps
ps2pdf scribe-manual-short.ps

# Note: this is a long manual; print it on a printer
# which prints two-sided copy.

# LATEX-DOCUMENTATION:
# Latex documentation can be processed similarly to the Scribe one. Just
# use the "latex-facilities.lisp" or "latex-facilities-(short/cmd/temp).lisp"
# instead of "scribe-facilities.lisp" or "scribe-facilities-(short/cmd/temp).lisp".
# Thus, in TPS you should execute:
# tload "/home/theorem/project/doc/facilities/latex-facilities.lisp"
# Compile file /home/theorem/project/doc/facilities/latex-facilities.lisp?>n
# 
# This produces tex files which can be finally compiled using, e.g. :
# % cd doc/facilities
# % latex latex-manual
# % dvips latex-manual
#
# If you want to produce the short facilities guide, in TPS you should execute:
# tload "/home/theorem/project/doc/facilities/latex-facilities-short.lisp"
# Compile file /home/theorem/project/doc/facilities/latex-facilities-short.lisp?>n
# This produces tex files which can be finally compiled using, e.g. :
# % cd doc/facilities
# % latex latex-manual-short
# % dvips latex-manual-short
