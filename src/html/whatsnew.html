</ul>
<hr>
<H2> Release notes for  distribution copy of October 30th 1997:</H2>
<UL>
<li>Dual instantiation of definitions and equalities has been implemented (see forthcoming paper).
<li>New methods for primitive substitution (discussed in the same paper) have also been implemented.
<li>New command TPS-TEST allows for a test run through a batch of proofs without requiring interaction
from the user.
<li>Major changes to the library facilities: both the default and backup directories may now be lists 
of directories. Multiple definitions of the same object are allowed, and the user is asked which definition
to use when such objects are loaded. SHOW-TIMING can now show the proof times for all instances of a
given object.
<li>Library objects are now stored with a PROVABILITY property, allowing for fast searches to find provable
(or unprovable) theorems.
<li>TPS now supports rewrite rules (for interactive proofs only). These may be bidirectional and/or polymorphic,
and may invoke arbitrary functions to test for applicability of the rule and to clean up afterwards 
(e.g. applying lambda-normalization after each application).
<li>Rewrite rules can be bundled into THEORIES for ease of use. Many theories can be stored in memory, to
be activated or deactivated as needed.
<li>Unification is now timed separately, so the user can see how much of the search time was spent on unification.
<li>The command UNIFORM-SEARCH has been improved.
<li>It is now possible to find out, during a proof search but without interrupting it,
the time that TPS has spent searching for a proof.
<li>The new command FINDPROOF searches through saved proof files for a proof of a given theorem.
<li>The flags SHORT-HELP and ALPHA-LOWER-FLAG reformat the output from HELP, ? and ?? in a more readable manner.
<li>Command completion of an ambiguous command now offers a list of possible completions instead of just failing.
<li>The command OOPS allows the user to make minor changes in the previous command without retyping it.
<li>ND Proofs containing assertions of reflexivity or transitivity of equality can now be rewritten automatically into
a form that can be translated by NAT-ETREE.
<li>The command AUTO-SUGGEST takes a ND proof and makes (not necessarily completely correct) suggestions about how to
set the flags for an automatic proof.
<li>Help messages are now available for flag settings as well as for flags.
<li>The command PAUSE allows greater user control over execution of work files.
<li>TeX output can now be formatted for LaTeX.
<li>TPS can now be run on a problem from the command line in "batch mode", with the output being sent to a file.
<li>The VPT command can now produce TeX output with the literal names in boxes.
<li>SKOLEM-DEFAULT SK3 and SKOLEM-DEFAULT NIL (corresponding, respectively, 
to skolemizing over just the free variables and to using selection nodes instead of skolemization) now work properly.
</ul>

<H2> Release notes for  distribution copy of June 18th 1996:</H2>
<UL>
<LI> <b>Interactive Proofs</b>
<ul>
<LI> Proofs, and lines within proofs, can now have comments attached to them.
<LI> Commands SAVE-SUBPROOF, CREATE-SUBPROOF, MERGE-PROOFS and TRANSFER-LINES allow
easy manipulation of partial proofs (e.g. pasting the proof of a lemma into a larger proof).
<LI> Command FIND-LINE looks for lines of a given form within a proof.
<LI> New command DIY-L for automatic proof of lemmas within an interactive proof.
<LI> New interactive proof commands ECONJ*, ICONJ*, UGEN*, CASES3, CASES4, ASSOC-LEFT, RULEC1, SUBST-EQUIV,

to eproofs.
</ul>
<LI> <b>Unification</b>
<ul>
<LI> Implementation of variable depth bounds in unification via MAX-SUBSTS-VAR
and its associated flags, bringing the time for THM15B (in the JAR paper) down from 2.5 hours 
to 1 minute.
<LI> Improved unification output via flags UNIF-COUNTER and UNIF-TRIGGER.
<LI> UN90 now allows breadth-first unification as well as depth-first.
<LI> Improvements to the unification routines; new flag DNEG-IMITATION, plus implementation
of a subsumption-checker, bringing the time for THM15B (in the JAR paper) down from 2.5 hours 
to 5 minutes.
<LI> New unification command UTREE* prints the unification tree in a tree format.
<LI> New unification command PP* prints detailed information about unification problems
(are they linear, monadic, second order, etc...?).
</ul>
<LI> <b>Automatic Proof Search</b>
<ul>
<LI> Implementation of variable time bounds for searches with primitive substitutions.
<LI> New (optional) method for generating primitive substitutions, by counting the number of
literals as well as the number of quantifiers. Governed by the flag PRIMSUB-METHOD.
</ul>
<LI> <b>Other Stuff</b>
<ul>
<LI> SCRIBEPROOF and TEXPROOF now allow more user control over the output format.
<LI> The SEARCH command now allows searches of all objects in the library.
<LI> SAVEPROOF now saves all related abbreviations as well.

<hr>
<H2> Release notes for  distribution copy of April 26th 1995:</H2>
<UL>
<LI> The new commands BUG-SAVE and BUG-RESTORE provide a uniform way to store information
about bugs in TPS. New commands BUG-LIST, BUG-HELP show all the stored information about
bugs.
<LI> The new matingstree top level has been implemented.
<LI> New editor commands to delete left or right scope of a binary connective.
<LI> New editor commands to embed the current wff under a connective or binder.
<LI> Pop-up windows can now use a different font from the main window.
<LI> Literals which are copies of each other can now be labelled as such: e.g., copies of
LEAF7 will be labelled LEAF7.1, LEAF7.2, etc.
<LI> It is now possible to print the proof structure as a tree rather than a list.
<LI> Mating searches can now be interrupted cleanly, and it is possible to continue searching
after such an interrupt.
<LI> Searches in the <i>test</i> top level now behave in a similar way to the <i>mate</i>
top level; this makes <i>test</i> more intuitive to use.
<LI> There is a new setting for ORDER-COMPONENTS which orders the conjunctions 
in a vpform from largest to smallest.
<LI> It is now possible to save unification problems created during mating search
in the library, and to restore them later. 
</ul>
<p></p>
<hr>
<H2> Release notes for  distribution copy of November 11th 1994:</H2>
<UL>
<LI> Natural deduction proofs now have the variables relabelled to make them more readable
(in particular, the same variable will not be used twice with different types, and superscripts
are eliminated where possible).
<LI> All known bugs in proof search have been fixed.
<LI> There is a new command <i>^PN</i>, which prints active lines in full and abbreviates other
lines to just the line number.
<LI> There is a new flag <i>ETREE-NAT-VERBOSE</i> which controls the output of <i>ETREE-NAT</i>
and can redirect it to the proofwindows.
<LI> <i>SCRIPT</i> files can now be produced in Scribe or TeX format.
<LI> Library files can now be sorted, with the <i>SORT</i> command.
<LI> The <i>KEY</i> command can now be used on the library, to find all library objects 
containing a given string.
<LI> Beta and eta conversion can now be done either separately or together or (in the case of 
eta conversion) not at all. This applies to both interactive and automatic proofs.
<LI> MS90-3 now handles truth values properly.
<LI> <i>EQUIV-EQ</i> now generates more useful default values.
<LI> The hypotheses for a new lemma no longer have to be the same as those of the conclusion (they can now be a subset).
<LI> The manuals have been heavily rewritten and updated.
<LI> A new flag <i>TURNSTILE-INDENT-AUTO</i> allows the user to improve the formatting of printed proofs.
<LI> There are new commands to reindex the library and purge it of backup files, 
and damaged library files can be salvaged automatically.
<LI> If TPS is given a mode name or a gwff name which it does not recognise, it will now automatically 
ask whether to search the library for an object of that name.
<LI> <i>MOVE*</i> now works properly.
<LI> The backtracking strategy for MS90-* has been made more efficient.
<LI> MS90-* now always prefers to duplicate the innermost quantifier of a jform.
<LI> The new <i>TPS-TEST</i> command allows long runs, without user intervention, in which many 
proofs are completed and all the timing details are recorded in a file.
<LI> Files in the patch file are now not loaded unless they have been changed since the last time 
TPS was built; this allows one patch file to work for many different versions of TPS all built 
at different times.
<LI> The new command <i>ETP</i> prints the shallow formula at all nodes of an etree.
<LI> The <i>test</i> top level has been considerably expanded, and it is now possible for TPS 
to automatically construct appropriate searchlists for either improving a correct mode, or finding
a correct mode.
<LI> The <i>test</i> top level will now fix the unification depths to the correct value as soon as 
it finds a proof, rather than continuing to vary them.
<LI> The flag <i>MIN-QUANT-ETREE</i> was implemented.
<LI> The flag <i>LAST-MODE-NAME</i> was implemented; TPS now records the name of the current mode 
when <i>DATEREC</i> is called.
<LI> The library command <i>SHOW-TIMING</i> was implemented; this prints out all the timing records
for a given theorem in the library.
<LI> The command <i>COMPARE-MODES</i> was implemented.
<LI> TPS can now measure garbage collecting time in Lucid CL.
<LI> The proofwindows, editor windows, etc. are now available in Lucid CL.
<LI> The problem in which an empty option set was generated many times in each MS91 search has been fixed.
