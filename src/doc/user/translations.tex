\chapter{Proof Translations and Tactics}

\section{Translation between proof formats; tactics}\label{tactics}
After a complete mating has been found, and the expansion tree correctly
instantiated with terms for variables, the expansion proof can be
translated into a natural deduction proof using the system's inference
rules.  This translation process is carried out by tactics.  The
following sections describe what tactics are and how to define them.  The
current tactics and tacticals of the system are listed in the facilities guide;
you can also get a complete listing of each by typing {\tt HELP TACTIC} or {\tt HELP TACTICAL}.

The \indexcommand{NAT-ETREE} can be used to
translate natural deduction proofs into expansion proofs.
See the section \ref{natetr} for more information about
\indexcommand{NAT-ETREE}.
