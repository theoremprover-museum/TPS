<p>	This tutorial will teach participants how to make effective use
of TPS and ETPS, and provide hands-on experience with these programs.

<p>	TPS is an automated theorem proving system which can be used
to prove theorems of first- or higher-order logic automatically,
interactively, or in a combination of these modes of operation.
Proofs in TPS are presented in natural deduction style.  ETPS is a
program which was obtained from TPS by deleting all the facilities for
proving theorems automatically.  ETPS can be used by students to learn
how to prove theorems interactively.

<p>	Information about TPS, including manuals and information about
obtaining the system, can be found at <a href="http://gtps.math.cmu.edu/tps.html">
http://gtps.math.cmu.edu/tps.html</a>.

<p>	There will be a discussion of how to use ETPS as a teaching
tool in logic courses. ETPS can be used effectively in a course which
is concerned purely with first-order logic as well as one which also
deals with higher-order logic.  Students using ETPS can construct
rigorous proofs of harder theorems than they would find it practical
to construct without ETPS.  ETPS gives students immediate feedback for
both correct and incorrect actions, checks proofs automatically, and
creates records of the theorems proved by each student which can be
automatically transferred to the teacher's grade file.

<p>	The logical language of TPS is Church's type theory, a
formulation of higher-order logic in which theorems of mathematics can
be expressed very naturally.  The notation of this language is
displayed on the screen and in printed proofs.  Definitions are
handled elegantly by lambda-notation.

<p>	Participants in the tutorial are expected to be familiar with
first-order logic, but no familiarity with higher-order logic will be
presupposed. There will be an introduction to the notation of type
theory, examples showing how to express theorems of mathematics
(including those involving inductive definitions) in this language,
and lessons on how to write theorems and definitions in TPS and put
them into a TPS library.

<p>	It will be shown how to use the rules of inference for
constructing natural deduction proofs, which are common to TPS and
ETPS.  Additional facilities for using tactics to apply these rules
semi-automatically, which are available in TPS but not in ETPS, will
also be exhibited. It will be shown how the automatic procedures in
TPS can be used to fill gaps in a partially completed natural
deduction proof.

<p>	TPS searches for proofs in automatic mode by first searching
for an expansion proof, and then translating this into a natural
deduction proof.  TPS has a number of search procedures, and there are
many flags which control the behavior of TPS and set bounds for the
many dimensions of proof search in higher-order logic. A discussion of
these matters will prepare the potential user of TPS to learn how to set 
the flags in ways that will produce automatic proofs of chosen theorems.

<p>	The tutorial will include a general survey of the many
features of TPS which make it a useful research tool.  These include
proof windows (where the proof, and the active lines of the proof, are
displayed as the proof is constructed interactively), facilities for
rearranging proofs and displaying selected parts of them, separate
top-levels for unification problems and mating searches, vertical path
diagrams, facilities for printing proofs in various styles including
tex, the formula editor, the library, online help, and documentation
(some of which is produced automatically).

<p>	Participants are encouraged to bring to the tutorial one or
more simple theorems about sets, functions, and relations (which need
not be theorems of first-order logic) which can be used as examples to
demonstrate how various things are done in TPS.
