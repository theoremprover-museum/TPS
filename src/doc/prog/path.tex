\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em Natural ordering} for paths based on the jform. Defined by 
induction on jforms. Let paths(J) denote the set of all full paths through 
jform J.
\begin{itemize}
\item $J = \bigvee^{n}_{i=1} jform_{i}$. Let $P_{i} \in paths(jform_{i})$. Then
$P_{i} < P_{j}$ if $i < j$.

\item $J = \bigwedge^{n}_{i=1} jform_{i}$. Let $P_{i} \in paths(jform_{i})$. 
Then \[P_{1}@P_{2}\ldots @P_{n} < P_{1}@P_{2}\ldots%
@P_{j-1}@P^{1}_{j}\ldots @P^{1}_{n} \mbox{\/\rm if\/} P_{j} < P^{1}_{j}\]

\end{itemize}

\item {\em Cheapest Paths}. By Induction on Jforms.
\begin{itemize}
\item $J = \bigvee^{n}_{i=1} jform_{i}$. Cheapest path in $paths(jform_{1})$.

\item $J = \bigwedge^{n}_{i=1} jform_{i}$. Let $P_{i} \in paths(jform_{i})$
such that $P_{i}$ is the cheapest path in $paths(jform_{i})$.
Then $P_{1}@P_{2}\ldots @P_{n}$ is the cheapest path in $J$.

\end{itemize}

\item {\em Finding the next path}. Given a path P, find the next path in
the ordering described above.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Backtracking to the last point at which there is an alternate choice.
This is the last disjunction where another choice can be made. Because we
are using full paths, this just requires removing elements from the path P
until such a disjunction is found.

\item Find the next path through this disjunction.

\item Complete this path wrt the entire jform. This requires starting from
the beginning until disjunction in step 1 is reached and then finding
the cheapest path.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
