\section{Top Levels}

\begin{description} 
\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{BEGIN-PRFW}] \index{BEGIN-PRFW@BEGIN-PRFW, {\bf MExpr}} 
Begin proofwindow top level.
Open Current Subproof, Current Subproof \&  Line Numbers, and Complete Proof
windows with text size determined by the value of the flag CHARSIZE.
Printing in various windows can be modified by changing the flags
PROOFW-ACTIVE, PROOFW-ALL, PROOFW-ACTIVE+NOS, BLANK-LINES-INSERTED 
and PRINTLINEFLAG.
The initial size of the windows can be modified with the flags
PROOFW-ALL-HEIGHT, PROOFW-ALL-WIDTH, PROOFW-ACTIVE-HEIGHT,
PROOFW-ACTIVE-WIDTH, PROOFW-ACTIVE+NOS-HEIGHT, and 
PROOFW-ACTIVE+NOS-WIDTH; after the windows are open, they can simply 
be resized as normal. PSTATUS will update the proofwindows manually
if necessary. 
Close the proofwindows with END-PRFW.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{DO-GRADES}] \index{DO-GRADES@DO-GRADES, {\bf MExpr}} 
Invoke the grading package.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{ED \textit{edwff}}] \index{ED@ED, {\bf MExpr}} 
Enter the editor on a given wff.
Editor windows may be initialized, depending the values of the flags 
EDWIN-TOP, EDWIN-CURRENT, EDWIN-VPFORM. The flags BLANK-LINES-INSERTED and 
CHARSIZE determine the layout of these windows. The flags 
EDWIN-{CURRENT,TOP,VPFORM}-WIDTH and EDWIN-{CURRENT,TOP,VPFORM}-HEIGHT 
determine the intial size of these windows; they may be resized after they are
opened in the usual way.
WARNING: Since editing is non-destructive, nothing is done with the result
of the editing process!

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{END-PRFW}] \index{END-PRFW@END-PRFW, {\bf MExpr}} 
End proofwindow top level; close all open proofwindows.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{EXT-MATE}] \index{EXT-MATE@EXT-MATE, {\bf MExpr}} 
Enter the EXT-MATE top level for building and manipulating
extensional expansion dags (see Chad E. Brown's thesis).

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{EXT-SEQ}] \index{EXT-SEQ@EXT-SEQ, {\bf MExpr}} 
Enter the EXT-SEQ top level for building and manipulating
extensional sequent derivations (see Chad E. Brown's thesis).

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{HISTORY \textit{n} \textit{reverse}}] \index{HISTORY@HISTORY, {\bf MExpr}} 
Show history list.  Shows the N most recent events; N defaults to 
the value of HISTORY-SIZE, showing entire history list. Values of N that 
are greater than HISTORY-SIZE have the same effect as the default value. 
REVERSE defaults to NO; if YES, most recent commands will be shown first.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{LIB}] \index{LIB@LIB, {\bf MExpr}} 
Enter the library top-level.

See Also: UNIXLIB (an alternative library top level)

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{MATE \textit{gwff} \textit{deepen} \textit{reinit} \textit{window}}] \index{MATE@MATE, {\bf MExpr}} 
Begin an expansion proof for a gwff.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{MODELS}] \index{MODELS@MODELS, {\bf MExpr}} 
Enter the MODELS top level for working with standard models
in which the base types (hence all types) are a power of 2.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{MTREE \textit{gwff} \textit{deepen} \textit{reset} \textit{window}}] \index{MTREE@MTREE, {\bf MExpr}} 
Begin to enter the mating tree top level.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{POP}] \index{POP@POP, {\bf MExpr}} 
Return from a top level started with PUSH.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PUSH}] \index{PUSH@PUSH, {\bf MExpr}} 
Start a new top level. This command is almost useless,
except from within a prompt (e.g. one can type PUSH in the middle 
of converting an etree to a ND proof interactively, call SCRIBEPROOF,
and then type POP to return to the conversion).

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{REVIEW}] \index{REVIEW@REVIEW, {\bf MExpr}} 
Enter REVIEW to examine and change flags or parameters.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{REWRITE \textit{p2} \textit{p1} \textit{a} \textit{b} \textit{p2-hyps} \textit{p1-hyps}}] \index{REWRITE@REWRITE, {\bf MExpr}} 
Rewrite a line of the current natural deduction proof in the
REWRITING top level. When finished rewriting, use OK to leave the REWRITING top
level, modifying the main proof accordingly.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{REWRITE-IN \textit{theory} \textit{p2} \textit{p1} \textit{a} \textit{b} \textit{p2-hyps} \textit{p1-hyps}}] \index{REWRITE-IN@REWRITE-IN, {\bf MExpr}} 
Rewrite a line in the REWRITING top level using a particular
theory.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{REWRITING}] \index{REWRITING@REWRITING, {\bf MExpr}} 
Enter the REWRITING top level.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{TEST \textit{gwff} \textit{deepen} \textit{reinit} \textit{window}}] \index{TEST@TEST, {\bf MExpr}} 
Enter the test top level. In this top level, the user can search
for an optimal mode in which to prove a particular theorem, by defining
a list of flags to be varied and then running matingsearch repeatedly 
with different flag settings.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{UNIFORM-SEARCH \textit{gwff} \textit{window} \textit{mode} \textit{slist} \textit{modify}}] \index{UNIFORM-SEARCH@UNIFORM-SEARCH, {\bf MExpr}} 
Enter the test top level to search for any mode that will prove
a given theorem. The mode provided by the user should list flag settings
that are not to be varied, and the searchlist provided by the user should
list all of the flags to be varied. The default settings for the mode and
searchlist are UNIFORM-SEARCH-MODE and UNIFORM-SEARCH-2.
If you opt for the searchlist to be automatically modified, TPS will inspect
the given wff to check whether it is first order, whether it contains any 
definitions, whether it contains any equalities (and if so whether the LEIBNIZ
and ALL instantiations are different), and whether it has any possible primitive
substitutions, and will then remove or modify any unnecessary flags from the 
searchlist (respectively, unification bounds will be deleted, REWRITE-DEFNS will
be deleted, REWRITE-EQUALITIES will be deleted or modified, and DEFAULT-MS will
be changed to a search without option sets).
Also, if you opt for the searchlist to be modified and there is a proof of this
theorem in memory, AUTO-SUGGEST will be run and you will be asked whether to 
modify the searchlist using the results it provides.

After entering the test top level with this command, type GO ! to start 
searching for a successful mode.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{UNIFORM-SEARCH-L \textit{goal} \textit{support} \textit{line-range} \textit{window} \textit{mode} \textit{slist} \textit{modify}}] \index{UNIFORM-SEARCH-L@UNIFORM-SEARCH-L, {\bf MExpr}} 
Enter the test top level to search for any mode that will prove
a given lemma. (Compare DIY-L) The mode provided by the user should list flag 
settings that are not to be varied, and the searchlist provided by the user should
list all of the flags to be varied. The default settings for the mode and
searchlist are UNIFORM-SEARCH-MODE and UNIFORM-SEARCH-2.
If you opt for the searchlist to be automatically modified, TPS will inspect
the given wff to check whether it is first order, whether it contains any 
definitions, whether it contains any equalities (and if so whether the LEIBNIZ
and ALL instantiations are different), and whether it has any possible primitive
substitutions, and will then remove or modify any unnecessary flags from the 
searchlist (respectively, unification bounds will be deleted, REWRITE-DEFNS will
be deleted, REWRITE-EQUALITIES will be deleted or modified, and DEFAULT-MS will
be changed to a search without option sets).
After entering the test top level with this command, type GO ! to start 
searching for a successful mode.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{UNIFY}] \index{UNIFY@UNIFY, {\bf MExpr}} 
Enter the unification top-level. The user can define disagreement sets
using the command ADD-DPAIR available in the unification top-level. If you
are entering from the MATE top level, the unification tree associated with 
the active-mating is passed on to the unification top-level.
Any changes made to this tree are destructive. Applicable only for
a higher-order unification problem. Uses MS88-style unification.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{UNIXLIB}] \index{UNIXLIB@UNIXLIB, {\bf MExpr}} 
Enter the library top-level with a unix style interface.

The value of the flag CLASS-SCHEME determines what classification scheme
is used to determine the virtual directory structure.

If the flag UNIXLIB-SHOWPATH is T, the prompt will be
<<CLASSSCHEME>:<PATH TO CLASS><num>>

If the flag UNIXLIB-SHOWPATH is NIL, the prompt will be
<LIB:<CLASS><num>>

The web site includes online documentation as well
as postscript manuals.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{HELP* \textit{keywords}}] \index{HELP*@HELP*, {\bf MExpr}} 
Give information about each of a list of TPS objects.
This is equivalent to doing HELP on each of them.

flag SHORT-HELP.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{HELP-GROUP \textit{keywords}}] \index{HELP-GROUP@HELP-GROUP, {\bf MExpr}} 
Give information about a group of TPS objects; specifically,
given the name of a category, a context, or a top level, 
list the help messages for every object in that class.
If given a list of names, it will list the help messages
for all the objects that fall into the intersection of these
classes (e.g. HELP-GROUP (MEXPR REWRITING) will show all the 
top-level commands in the context REWRITING).
NOTE: Remember that the name of a context is not necessarily
the name that prints on the screen; do HELP CONTEXT
to show their real names.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{LIST-RULES}] \index{LIST-RULES@LIST-RULES, {\bf MExpr}} 
List all rules with their suggestion priority.

Replace the word at a given position in the previous line
with another word. Positions start from 0, and the substituted-for
command will be entered into the command history list, so for example:
<9>HELP GR-FILENAMES
<10>OOPS 0 LIST      (calls LIST GR-FILENAMES instead)
<11>OOPS 1 GR-MISC   (calls LIST GR-MISC)

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PROBLEMS \textit{show-defns}}] \index{PROBLEMS@PROBLEMS, {\bf MExpr}} 
This command will list the names of all exercises available in ETPS.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{SEARCH \textit{phrase} \textit{search-names}}] \index{SEARCH@SEARCH, {\bf MExpr}} 
Look for a key phrase in all help strings (or just all names) 
of TPS objects. See also KEY, in the review top level (where it searches 
through the flags) and the library top level (where it searches through
the library objects).

\section{Starting and Finishing}

\begin{description} 
\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{ALIAS \textit{name} \textit{def}}] \index{ALIAS@ALIAS, {\bf MExpr}} 
Define an alias DEF for the symbol NAME.  Works just like the
alias command in the Unix csh.  If the value of NAME is *ALL*, all
aliases will be printed; if the value of DEF is the empty string, then
the current alias definition of NAME will be printed.  See UNALIAS.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{CLEANUP}] \index{CLEANUP@CLEANUP, {\bf MExpr}} 
If the proof is complete, will delete unnecessary lines 
from a proof.  It may also eliminate or suggest eliminating
unnecessary hypotheses.

filename completion is done.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Printing}

\begin{description} 
\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{BUILD-PROOF-HIERARCHY}] \index{BUILD-PROOF-HIERARCHY@BUILD-PROOF-HIERARCHY, {\bf MExpr}} 
This command builds hierarchical information into the proof outline.
The information includes associations between lines and linear chains
of inferences which trace the consequences of the most recent hypothesis
of a line.  That is, a line 

ln) Hn,m |- an

would be associated with a linear chain of lines l1,...,ln
where m is the line corresponding to the most recent hypothesis and
the proof would justify the modified lines

l1) H1,m |- l1
l2) H2,l1 |- l2
l3) H3,l2 |- l3  
. . .
ln) Hn,ln-1 |- ln

where H1 < H2 < . . . < Hn (subset relation). 

That is, we trace the consequences of the hypothesis m to the
consequence ln.  Such a linear chain is on one level of the hierarchy.
One level down on the hierarchy would be the linear chains associated
with each of the lines used to justify l1,...,ln (except those which
appear in the chain l1,...,ln).  If the proof is complete,
then lines l1 and m will be the same.

Lines without hypotheses are also associated with such
"linear chains", following the rule that l1 < l2 if
the proof justifies the inference l1 |- l2.

The resulting hierarchy information is used by PBRIEF, EXPLAIN,
and PRINT-PROOF-STRUCTURE to help users focus on the logical
structure of a proof.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{DEPTH \textit{num}}] \index{DEPTH@DEPTH, {\bf MExpr}} 
Causes all subformulas at depth greater than n to be printed as \& .

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{EXPLAIN \textit{line} \textit{depth}}] \index{EXPLAIN@EXPLAIN, {\bf MExpr}} 
This command explains a line of a proof outline.
In particular, the command BUILD-PROOF-HIERARCHY builds
dependency information into a proof outline which allows
the proof outline to be viewed as a hierarchy of subproofs (see
help for BUILD-PROOF-HIERARCHY).  The command EXPLAIN shows
the lines included in the levels of this hierarchy (to the 
specified depth) starting at the level associated with the 
specified line.  Some flags which affect the printing include:
PRINT-COMBINED-UIS, PRINT-COMBINED-UGENS, PRINT-COMBINED-EGENS,
and PRINT-UNTIL-UI-OR-EGEN.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{FIND-LINE \textit{wff} \textit{vars} \textit{meta}}] \index{FIND-LINE@FIND-LINE, {\bf MExpr}} 
Find all lines matching a certain wff, up to
alphabetic change of bound variables and (possibly) 
alphabetic change of a given list of free variables.
Optionally, you can treat the remaining free variables
as matching any given term (as you might do if you were
asserting an axiom).
e.g. (suppose P is an abbreviation or constant):
FIND-LINE "P a" () NO       finds all lines that say "P a"
FIND-LINE "P a" ("a") NO    also finds "P x" and "P y"
FIND-LINE "P a" () YES      finds all the above, plus 
                              "P [COMPOSE f g]"
FIND-LINE "a x" ("x") YES   finds all lines of the form
                              "SOME-TERM some-var"

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PALL}] \index{PALL@PALL, {\bf MExpr}} 
	Print all the lines in the current proof outline.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PBRIEF \textit{depth}}] \index{PBRIEF@PBRIEF, {\bf MExpr}} 
This command prints a proof outline, hiding some lines.
In particular, the command BUILD-PROOF-HIERARCHY builds
dependency information into a proof outline which allows
the proof outline to be viewed as a hierarchy of subproofs (see
help for BUILD-PROOF-HIERARCHY).  The command PBRIEF shows
the lines included in the top levels of this hierarchy (to the 
specified depth). PBRIEF is essentially a call to the command EXPLAIN
with the last line of the proof outline as the LINE argument (see help 
for EXPLAIN).  Some flags which affect the printing include:
PRINT-COMBINED-UIS, PRINT-COMBINED-UGENS, PRINT-COMBINED-EGENS,
and PRINT-UNTIL-UI-OR-EGEN.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PL \textit{num1} \textit{num2}}] \index{PL@PL, {\bf MExpr}} 
	Print all proof lines in a given range.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PL* \textit{print-ranges}}] \index{PL*@PL*, {\bf MExpr}} 
Print all proof lines in given ranges.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PLINE \textit{line}}] \index{PLINE@PLINE, {\bf MExpr}} 
	Print a specified line.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PPLAN \textit{pline}}] \index{PPLAN@PPLAN, {\bf MExpr}} 
	Print a planned line and all its supports.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PRINT-PROOF-STRUCTURE}] \index{PRINT-PROOF-STRUCTURE@PRINT-PROOF-STRUCTURE, {\bf MExpr}} 
This prints the structure of the proof outline.  The
structure is generated by BUILD-PROOF-HIERARCHY.  Linear chains
of line numbers are printed which indicate the logical chains of
inferences.  Each link in a linear chain is indicated by an
arrow (l1)->(l2) where l1 and l2 are line numbers.  If line l2
does not follow in a single step from l1 (i.e., by a single application 
of an inference rules), then PRINT-PROOF-STRUCTURE will also show the
linear chains of inference used to justify (l1)->(l2).  Some lines
(such as those without hypotheses and planned lines) are
exceptions.  These top level lines are sometimes printed alone 
(instead of in arrow notation).  This could be read TRUE->(l) 
to maintain consistent notation, but the notation (l) appears 
more readable in practice.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PRW \textit{gwff}}] \index{PRW@PRW, {\bf MExpr}} 
Print real wff. Turns off special characters
(including FACE definitions), infix notation, and dot 
notation, and then prints the wff.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PW \textit{gwff}}] \index{PW@PW, {\bf MExpr}} 
Print gwff.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PWSCOPE \textit{gwff}}] \index{PWSCOPE@PWSCOPE, {\bf MExpr}} 
print gwff with all brackets restored.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PWTYPES \textit{gwff}}] \index{PWTYPES@PWTYPES, {\bf MExpr}} 
Prints a wff showing types.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{SHOWNOTYPES}] \index{SHOWNOTYPES@SHOWNOTYPES, {\bf MExpr}} 
Suppress the printing of types on all wffs.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{SHOWTYPES}] \index{SHOWTYPES@SHOWTYPES, {\bf MExpr}} 
From now on show the types on all wffs.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{TABLEAU \textit{line}}] \index{TABLEAU@TABLEAU, {\bf MExpr}} 
Print the part of the proof which justifies the given line,
in a natural deduction tableau format.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{\textasciicircum P}] \index{\textasciicircum P@\textasciicircum P, {\bf MExpr}} 
Print current plan-support pair in the proof.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{\textasciicircum PN}] \index{\textasciicircum PN@\textasciicircum PN, {\bf MExpr}} 
Print current plan-support pair in the proof, as in \textasciicircum P, but 
also print just the line numbers of the other lines in the proof.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Saving Work}

\begin{description} 
\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{EXECUTE-FILE \textit{comfil} \textit{execprint} \textit{outfil} \textit{stepping}}] \index{EXECUTE-FILE@EXECUTE-FILE, {\bf MExpr}} 
Execute commands from a SAVE-WORK file.
Call this from the main top level or the proofwindows top level of TPS.
Note that this will not save subsequent commands in the same file,
which distinguishes it from RESTORE-WORK.
In the cases where EXECUTE-FILE doesn't work, one can usually just 
load the .work file into an editor and then cut and paste it, whole, 
into the TPS window.
Single-stepping only works between commands on the main top level;
it will not stop at prompts which are internal to a command, nor between
commands on a different top level. To force a work-file to stop in
such a place, use the PAUSE command when creating the work file.
If you are single-stepping through a file, you can 
abort at any time by typing \textasciicircum G<RETURN>.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{FINDPROOF \textit{name}}] \index{FINDPROOF@FINDPROOF, {\bf MExpr}} 
Searches your home directory and the directories listed in
SOURCE-PATH, looking for a proof whose name contains the given string.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{FINISH-SAVE}] \index{FINISH-SAVE@FINISH-SAVE, {\bf MExpr}} 
Finishing saving work in a file.
The difference between STOP-SAVE and FINISH-SAVE is: 
the former is temporary because you can use RESUME-SAVE
to resume saving work into the same file; the latter closes 
the output stream, so you can not save work into the same 
file after executing it.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PAUSE}] \index{PAUSE@PAUSE, {\bf MExpr}} 
Force a work file to stop and query the user. PAUSE, like ABORT, is valid
both as a top-level command and as a response to a prompt; it prints the 
message "Press RETURN, or \textasciicircum G RETURN to abort.", waits for such a response 
from the user, and then repeats the original prompt.
This command is of no use unless a work file is being created; see EXECUTE-FILE 
for more details.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{RESTORE-WORK \textit{comfil} \textit{execprint} \textit{outfil}}] \index{RESTORE-WORK@RESTORE-WORK, {\bf MExpr}} 
Execute commands from a SAVE-WORK file and continue
to save in that file. See EXECUTE-FILE for more information.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{RESTOREPROOF \textit{savefile}}] \index{RESTOREPROOF@RESTOREPROOF, {\bf MExpr}} 
Reads a natural deduction proof from a file created by SAVEPROOF
and makes it the current proof.  A security feature prevents the 
restoration of saved proofs which have been altered in any way.
Retrieve any definitions which are used in the proof and stored in the
library before restoring the proof. If you don't specify a directory,
it will first try your home directory and then all the directories 
listed in SOURCE-PATH.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{RESUME-SAVE}] \index{RESUME-SAVE@RESUME-SAVE, {\bf MExpr}} 
Use this command to resume saving commands into the most recent
save-work file.  Unlike RESTORE-WORK, this command doesn't
execute commands from the file, but simply appends subsequent commands to

Also, you may run into trouble if you forgot to save some commands.

Saves part of the current natural deduction proof to 
the specified file in a form in which it can be restored.  
The line ranges specified will be increased to include all the
other lines on which the given lines depend. See the help 
message for LINE-RANGE to find out what a line-range should 
look like. An example list is: 1--10 15--23 28 34--35
Also creates a new proof in memory with the given name, and
makes that the current proof.
Use RESTOREPROOF to restore the proof.
Overwrites the file if it already exists.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{SAVE-WORK \textit{savefile}}] \index{SAVE-WORK@SAVE-WORK, {\bf MExpr}} 
Start saving commands in the specified file. These commands can be
executed subsequently by using EXECUTE-FILE or RESTORE-WORK. If you are 
creating a work file for a demonstration, and need it to pause at certain
points as it is reloaded by TPS, then see the help message for EXECUTE-FILE
for more information on how to do this.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{SAVEPROOF \textit{savefile}}] \index{SAVEPROOF@SAVEPROOF, {\bf MExpr}} 
Saves the current natural deduction proof to the specified file in
a form in which it can be restored.  Use RESTOREPROOF to restore the proof.
Overwrites the file if it already exists.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{SCRIPT \textit{scriptfile} \textit{if-exists-append}}] \index{SCRIPT@SCRIPT, {\bf MExpr}}

of STYLE is SCRIBE or TEX, an appropriate header will be output to the 
script file (unless the file already exists).
**NOTE** If you start SCRIPT from a PUSHed top level, be sure to do 
UNSCRIPT before you POP that top level, or your transcript may be lost.
The same also applies to starting SCRIPT from subtoplevels such as MATE;
you can enter further subtoplevels like LIB and ED from the MATE top level,
and SCRIPT will carry on recording, but before leaving the MATE top level 
you should type UNSCRIPT or your work will be lost.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{STOP-SAVE}] \index{STOP-SAVE@STOP-SAVE, {\bf MExpr}}

plus all the lines on which they depend, and makes that 
the current proof.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{LINE-COMMENT \textit{line} \textit{comment}}] \index{LINE-COMMENT@LINE-COMMENT, {\bf MExpr}} 
Attach a comment to a given existing line.
The comment will be parsed for gwffs and line numbers
as follows: anything enclosed in \#  symbols is assumed to
be a gwff, and anything enclosed in \$  symbols is assumed
to be the number of an existing line. Line numbers in 
comments will be updated as lines are moved around;
gwffs will be printed in the current STYLE.
Examples:
"1st copy of line \$ 5\$ , instantiated with \# COMPOSE\# "
"2nd copy of line \$ 5\$ , instantiated with ITERATE"
"3rd copy of line \$ 5\$ , instantiated with \# a OR b\# "
(The first prints the definition of COMPOSE; the
second prints the word "ITERATE", and the third prints
the given gwff. If line 5 is subsequently renumbered, 
the line number will change in all these comments.)

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{MERGE-PROOFS \textit{proof} \textit{subproof}}] \index{MERGE-PROOFS@MERGE-PROOFS, {\bf MExpr}} 
Merges all of the lines of a subproof into the current 
proof. If EXPERTFLAG is NIL, no line number may occur in both proofs.
If EXPERTFLAG is T, then if a line number occurs in both proofs, the 
lines to which they refer must be the same (with one exception: if 
one is a planned line and the other is the same line with a 
justification, then the justified line will overwrite the planned one).
Compare TRANSFER-LINES.

The following proofs are in memory:

For more details, use the PROOFLIST command.


\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PROOF-COMMENT \textit{comment}}] \index{PROOF-COMMENT@PROOF-COMMENT, {\bf MExpr}} 
Attaches a comment to the current proof.
The default value is the current comment. Uses the same
comment syntax as LINE-COMMENT; see the help message of that command
for more information. You can see the comments on all the 
current proofs by using PROOFLIST.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PROOFLIST}] \index{PROOFLIST@PROOFLIST, {\bf MExpr}} 
Print a list of all proofs or partial proofs currently in memory.
Also prints the final line of each proof and the comment, if
any, attached to it.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{TRANSFER-LINES \textit{proof} \textit{subproof} \textit{lines}}] \index{TRANSFER-LINES@TRANSFER-LINES, {\bf MExpr}} 
Copies all of the given lines of a subproof, and
all lines on which they depend, into the current proof. 
If EXPERTFLAG is NIL, no line number may occur in both proofs.
If EXPERTFLAG is T, then if a line number occurs in both proofs, the 
lines to which they refer must be the same (with one exception: if 
one is a planned line and the other is the same line with a 
justification, then the justified line will overwrite the planned one).
Different comments from two otherwise identical lines will be 
concatenated to form the comment in the resulting proof.

This is equivalent to CREATE-SUBPROOF followed by MERGE-PROOFS.

The following proofs are in memory:

Given a completed natural deduction proof (which must
be the current dproof; use RECONSIDER to return to an old proof),
suggest flag settings for an automatic proof of the same theorem.

This will also automatically remove all uses of SUBST=
and SYM= from the proof (you will be prompted before this
happens, as it permanently modifies the proof).

This will show all of the instantiations (and primitive substitutions)
that are necessary for the proof, and suggest settings for 
NUM-OF-DUPS, MAX-MATES, DEFAULT-MS, MAX-PRIM-DEPTH, MAX-PRIM-LITS 
and REWRITE-DEFNS

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{ETR-AUTO-SUGGEST}] \index{ETR-AUTO-SUGGEST@ETR-AUTO-SUGGEST, {\bf MExpr}}

DO IT YOURSELF. Calls matingsearch procedure specified by the flag 
DEFAULT-MS with specified planned line and supports, then translates the 
resulting proof to natural deduction. Allows some of the output to be sent to 
a separate vpform window (equivalent to issuing the OPEN-MATEVPW command
before typing DIY).

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{DIY-L \textit{goal} \textit{support} \textit{window} \textit{range}}] \index{DIY-L@DIY-L, {\bf MExpr}}

DIY for lemmas (with timeout).  Calls diy-l with a timeout value
in seconds.  The timeout value applies only to mating search.  That is,
as long as mating search succeeds within the allotted time, merging

function and parameters. See NOMONITOR. See also QUERY-USER for an
alternative way to monitor the progress of the matingsearch.
For a list of monitor functions, type MONITORLIST. To change the current
monitor function, enter the name of the desired new monitor function from
the main top level or the mate top level.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{MONITORLIST}] \index{MONITORLIST@MONITORLIST, {\bf MExpr}} 
List all monitor functions.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{NOMONITOR}] \index{NOMONITOR@NOMONITOR, {\bf MExpr}}

function and parameters. See MONITOR.
For a list of monitor functions, type MONITORLIST. To change the current 
monitor function, enter the name of the desired new monitor function from
the main top level or the mate top level.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PIY \textit{wff} \textit{prefix} \textit{num} \textit{window}}] \index{PIY@PIY, {\bf MExpr}} 
PROVE IT YOURSELF. Combines the prove command with diy - allowing a choice
of a mode for trying to prove a theorem automatically.

\section{MS91-6 and MS91-7 search procedures}

\begin{description} 
\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{SEARCH-ORDER \textit{num} \textit{vpf} \textit{verb}}] \index{SEARCH-ORDER@SEARCH-ORDER, {\bf MExpr}} 
Generates the first n option sets that will be searched under 
the current flag settings (assuming that the first (n-1) searches fail
because they run out of time rather than for any other reason).
This will show the names and weights of the option sets, the 
primitive substitutions and duplications. 
Note : "Ordinary" duplications are duplications that have not 
had a primsub applied to them. So, for example, "X has 2 primsubs 
plus 3 ordinary duplications" means that the vpform now contains 
five copies of the relevant quantifier, two of which have had 
primsubs applied to them.

\section{Proof Translation}

\begin{description} 
\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{ETREE-NAT \textit{prefix} \textit{num} \textit{tac} \textit{mode}}] \index{ETREE-NAT@ETREE-NAT, {\bf MExpr}} 
Translates the current expansion proof, which is value of internal
variable current-eproof, into a natural deduction style proof. The default
value of the tactic is given by the flag DEFAULT-TACTIC.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{NAT-ETREE \textit{prefix}}] \index{NAT-ETREE@NAT-ETREE, {\bf MExpr}} 
Translates a natural deduction proof, (which must be the current dproof
-- use RECONSIDER to return to an old proof in memory), into an 
expansion proof. This will not work on all proofs: in particular,
proofs containing ASSERT of anything but REFL= and SYM=, proofs 
using rewrite rules and proofs containing SUBST= or SUB= cannot be
translated at present.  

There are several versions of nat-etree.  Set the flag
NAT-ETREE-VERSION to determine which version to use.

In all but the OLD version, the user is given the option of
removing lines justified by SUBST=, SUB=, or SYM= and replacing the justification
with a subproof.  This permanently modifies the proof.  (AUTO-SUGGEST
also gives such an option.)

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{NORMALIZE-PROOF \textit{prefix}}] \index{NORMALIZE-PROOF@NORMALIZE-PROOF, {\bf MExpr}} 
Normalize a natural deduction proof.  The actual procedure
uses DEASSERT-LEMMAS to combine asserted lemmas into one big natural
deduction proof.  This is the converted into a sequent calculus
derivations with cuts.  A cut elimination (which may not terminate
in principle) creates a cut-free proof which is translated back
to a normal natural deduction proof.

To suppress excessive output, try setting the following flags
NATREE-DEBUG, ETREE-NAT-VERBOSE and PRINTLINEFLAG
to NIL and TACTIC-VERBOSE to MIN.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PFNAT \textit{proof}}] \index{PFNAT@PFNAT, {\bf MExpr}} 
To generate a NATREE from given proof and store it in CURRENT-NATREE. This may
evolve into a command for rearranging natural deduction style proofs.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{PNTR}] \index{PNTR@PNTR, {\bf MExpr}}

Expands applications of RuleP in the current natural deduction proof
into more primitive rules.  This works by calling fast propositional search with
the current flag settings except USE-RULEP is set to NIL.
BASIC-PROP-TAC is used to translate to natural deduction.

This command also eliminates other 'fancy' propositional justifications:
Assoc (Assoc-Left), EquivConj (in favor of EquivImplics),
Imp-Disj-L, Imp-Disj-R, Imp-Disj, Disj-Imp-L, Disj-Imp-R, and Disj-Imp.

See Also: 
ELIMINATE-RULEP-LINE - which eliminates a particular application of RuleP.
ELIMINATE-CONJ*-RULEP-APPS - which does not depend on automatic search.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{ELIMINATE-CONJ*-RULEP-APPS \textit{pfname}}] \index{ELIMINATE-CONJ*-RULEP-APPS@ELIMINATE-CONJ*-RULEP-APPS, {\bf MExpr}} 
Expands applications of RuleP in the current natural deduction proof
when they can be replaced by a sequence of IConj or EConj applications.

This reverses the effect of the ICONJ* and ECONJ* tactics which are often
used when translating from an expansion proof to a natural deduction proof.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{ELIMINATE-RULEP-LINE \textit{line}}] \index{ELIMINATE-RULEP-LINE@ELIMINATE-RULEP-LINE, {\bf MExpr}} 
Expands an application of RuleP in the current natural deduction proof
into more primitive rules.  This works by calling fast propositional search with
the current flag settings except USE-RULEP is set to NIL.

the global parameter GO-INSTRUCTIONS.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{GO2 \textit{tacmode}}] \index{GO2@GO2, {\bf MExpr}} 
Apply all possible invertible tactics, until no more are possible.
This is equivalent to typing USE-TACTIC GO2-TAC NAT-DED.
The amount of output to the main window and the proofwindows is 
determined by the flag ETREE-NAT-VERBOSE.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{MONSTRO \textit{tacmode}}] \index{MONSTRO@MONSTRO, {\bf MExpr}} 
This is equivalent to typing USE-TACTIC MONSTRO-TAC NAT-DED.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{OPEN-MATEVPW \textit{filename}}] \index{OPEN-MATEVPW@OPEN-MATEVPW, {\bf MExpr}} 
Open a window which will display the current vpform and substitution stack,
if any. The window can be closed with the command CLOSE-MATEVPW. The size 
of the text is determined by the flag CHARSIZE, and the current width of the window 
by the flag VPW-WIDTH. The initial height of the window is determined by VPW-HEIGHT

This may leave the given line as a planned line.
The user is given the option of also deleting some hypotheses
from lines after the given line.  If possible, the user
is given the option of deleting some hypotheses from lines

a planned line.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{INTRODUCE-GAP \textit{line} \textit{num}}] \index{INTRODUCE-GAP@INTRODUCE-GAP, {\bf MExpr}} 
Introduce a gap in an existing proof.

Prevent a line from being deleted.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{MAKE-ASSERT-A-HYP \textit{l}}] \index{MAKE-ASSERT-A-HYP@MAKE-ASSERT-A-HYP, {\bf MExpr}} 
Take a line justified by Assert, change its justification to Hyp,
make lines after it include this as a hypothesis, and perform a 
Deduct at the end so that the new proof does not depend on the Assert.

We may want to use this before calling nat-etree, since this does
not handle most Asserts.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{QLOAD \textit{filespec}}] \index{QLOAD@QLOAD, {\bf MExpr}} 
Load the most recent compiled or uncompiled file from your default
directory, home directory, or source path. In general, the following rules
are used to determine whether compiled or uncompiled file should be load in:
(1) If the file name with extension '.lisp', always load the uncompiled source code.
(2) If the file name without extension, then
    (2.1) if both compiled and uncompiled file exist, and 
          (2.1.1) the compiled one is newer, it is loaded in.
          (2.1.2) the uncompiled one is newer, 
                  (2.1.2.1) if the flag 'expertflag' is NIL, always load the uncompiled 
                            source code.
                  (2.1.2.2) if the flag 'expertflag' is T, ask user whether load the uncompiled
                            one, or compile it and load the compiled one then.
    (2.2) if only the compiled one exists, load it in.
    (2.3) if only the uncompiled one exists, do the same as case (2.1.2)

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{SETUP-ONLINE-ACCESS}] \index{SETUP-ONLINE-ACCESS@SETUP-ONLINE-ACCESS, {\bf MExpr}}

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{SYS-LOAD \textit{modulelist}}] \index{SYS-LOAD@SYS-LOAD, {\bf MExpr}} 
Load all the modules in the given list, whether they
are loaded already or not.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{TEST-INIT}] \index{TEST-INIT@TEST-INIT, {\bf MExpr}} 
Initialize the flag TEST-THEOREMS to test a collection
of theorems on a collection of modes.  This command should be
followed by TPS-TEST which actually tries to prove the theorems
with the modes.

There are currently several possibilities:

1.  Set TEST-THEOREMS to test a given set of theorems on
a given set of modes.  The default set of modes is determined
by the value of the flag GOODMODES.

2.  Set TEST-THEOREMS to test the set of modes given by the flag
GOODMODES on theorems that have a bestmode in the library
(determined by DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR) but are not 
known to be provable by some mode in the GOODMODES list.

3.  Set TEST-THEOREMS to test a set of modes given by the flag
GOODMODES on all the theorems the modes are supposed to prove.
(This tests whether a list of GOODMODES is still complete 
with respect to the corresponding list of theorems.)

4. Set TEST-THEOREMS to test all of the best
modes known to the library on all the theorems listed with
the best modes. By default, this will choose the first
mode listed for each theorem in the bestmodes.rec file; if you
choose to use multiple modes then it will test each theorem
with all of the modes listed for it in that file.  The examples
are listed in order from quickest to longest.
(This checks that all the theorems associated with bestmodes 
can still be proven by these bestmodes.)

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{TLIST \textit{symbol}}] \index{TLIST@TLIST, {\bf MExpr}} 
Use a help function to display all of the property list of a symbol.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{TLOAD \textit{filespec}}] \index{TLOAD@TLOAD, {\bf MExpr}} 
Load the most recent compiled or uncompiled file from your default
directory, home directory, or source-path. In general, the following rules are
used to determine whether compiled or uncompiled file should be load in:
(1) If both compiled and uncompiled file exist, and 
    (1.1) the compiled one is newer, it is loaded in.
    (1.2) the uncompiled one is newer, then
          (1.2.1) if the global variable core::*allow-compile-source* is T, the
                  name of the file contains extension 

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{TPS-TEST \textit{stop-on-success} \textit{mate-only} \textit{record} \textit{moderec} \textit{quiet-run} \textit{expu} \textit{newcore} \textit{modify} \textit{output} \textit{timing} \textit{testwin}}] \index{TPS-TEST@TPS-TEST, {\bf MExpr}} 
Attempt to prove a list of theorems.

The list of theorems, with the modes to be used, is stored as (theorem . mode) 
pairs in the flag TEST-THEOREMS. These theorems and modes will be fetched from
the library, if they cannot be found in TPS and if you have a library. You 
should set DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR appropriately. You can only do
DATEREC after each theorem if you have a library you can write to. 

The first argument STOP-ON-SUCCESS decides whether TPS-TEST should stop
trying to prove a particular theorem with different modes after one
mode has succeeded.  If this is T, then after TPS-TEST proves THM with MODE1,
where (THM . MODE1) is on TEST-INIT, TPS-TEST will not try to prove (THM . MODE2)
for any (THM . MODE2) on TEST-INIT.  It will however, continue to try to prove
other theorems on TEST-INIT with different modes (if there are any).

Quiet running uses the mode QUIET to switch off as much screen output as possible.

You can EXPUNGE between proofs (this will reduce the amount of memory
required, but will mean that other expansion proofs in the memory may
be lost; it will also re-assert your default flag values between each
proof).  Expunging does not really recover all the space used by TPS,
so many repeated proof attempts will result in running out of memory.
To remedy this situation, TPS-TEST can start a new core image for each
proof attempt.  In this case, each core image will start with a fresh
memory.  (When this option is chosen, expunging is irrelevant.)
Certain operating systems and versions of Lisp may not support
this option.

If TPS-TEST is running a new core image for each proof attempt, the
user can interrupt the slave core image using Control-C.  This should
throw one to the debugger level of the slave image.  In Allegro Lisp,
:res will cause the slave to die and throw the user to the debugger
level of the master core image.  Another :res will return the user to
the TPS top level of the master core image.

If the argument MODIFY is T, then the flag TEST-MODIFY can be 
used to change flag settings after loading each mode but before
searching.  See the help message for TEST-MODIFY for more information.

In versions of Common Lisp with multiprocessing (e.g., Allegro 5.0 or
later), the user can specify a time limit for each proof attempt.  The
user can also ask TPS-TEST to iterate trying every (THM . MODE) on
TEST-THEOREMS, increasing the time limit by a factor on each
iteration.  A (THM . MODE) is only tried again with a longer time if
it timed out on the previous attempt.  When multiprocessing is not
available (or if the user specifies an INFINITE time limit), TPS will
search for a proof using a given mode as long as permitted by that
mode.

If TPS-TEST encounters a bug, it will go on to the next (THM . MODE) pair.

The output file is kept independently of DATEREC records, and consists of a record
for each (THM . MODE) pair stating that the theorem was proved at a certain
time using a certain mode, or that the proof terminated with proof lines still 
remaining or that tps encountered an error.  Timing information can also
be sent to the short file if necessary.

If the short file already exists, the old copy will be renamed by adding 
.bak to its name.

See the help messages for TEST-THEOREMS, TEST-INIT and TEST-MODIFY for more information.

\item[\parbox{\textwidth}{TPS-TEST2 \textit{searchlist} \textit{quiet-run} \textit{expu} \textit{output} \textit{testwin}}] \index{TPS-TEST2@TPS-TEST2, {\bf MExpr}} 
Like TPS-TEST (see the help message for that command), but calls
the TEST top level and attempts to prove one theorem repeatedly with several
different values of some crucial flags, to see how the time taken will vary.

TEST-THEOREMS should contain a list of dotted pairs of theorems and modes 
in which they can be proven; the searchlist which is used should have at 
least one setting in which the theorem can be proven (otherwise tps-test2
will never finish that theorem).

The output file (by default, tps-test2-output.doc) will contain a summary of 
the results. If this file already exists, it will be renamed by adding .bak 
to its name.

\section{Tactics}

\begin{description} 
\item[CALL] \index{CALL} 
(CALL command) will execute command as if it were entered at the
top level by the user.  CALL is used only for side effects, the goal is
always returned.

\item[COMPOSE] \index{COMPOSE} 
(COMPOSE tac1 tac2 ... tacn) will apply its argument tactics
in order, composing their results until one of them fails.

\item[FAILTAC] \index{FAILTAC} 
Tactical which always fails, returns its goal unchanged.

\item[IDTAC] \index{IDTAC} 
Tactical which always succeeds, returns its goal unchanged.

\item[IFTHEN] \index{IFTHEN} 
(IFTHEN test tactic1 [tactic2]) will first evaluate test, which may
be either a tactical or (if user is an expert) an arbitrary LISP expression.
If test is a tactical and does not fail, or is a LISP expression which does
not evaluate to nil, then tactic1 will be executed and IFTHEN will return its
results.  If test fails or is nil, then tactic2  (if present) will be executed
and its results returned by IFTHEN.  Tactic2 is optional; if not specified,
and test fails, IFTHEN will return failure.

\item[NO-GOAL] \index{NO-GOAL} 
(NO-GOAL) succeeds iff the goal with which it is invoked is nil.

\item[ORELSE] \index{ORELSE} 
Given a list of tactics, ORELSE will apply the first one which succeeds.

\item[REPEAT] \index{REPEAT} 
(REPEAT tactic) will apply tactic repeatedly until it fails on
every subgoal which has been created.

\item[SEQUENCE] \index{SEQUENCE} 
(SEQUENCE TAC1 ... TACn) applies tactics TAC1, ..., TACn in order,
regardless of their success or failure. 

\item[THEN] \index{THEN} 
(THEN tactic1 tactic2) will first apply tactic1; if it fails
 then failure is returned, otherwise tactic2 is applied to each resulting
 goal.  If tactic2 fails on any of these goals, then failure is returned,
 otherwise the new goals obtained from the calls to tactic2 are returned.

\item[THEN*] \index{THEN*} 
(THEN* tactic1 tactic2) will first apply tactic1; if it fails
 then failure is returned, otherwise tactic2 is applied to each resulting
 goal.  If tactic2 fails on any of these goals, then the new goals obtained
 as a result of applying tactic1 are returned, otherwise the new goals
 obtained as the result of applying both tactic1 and tactic2 are returned.

\item[THEN**] \index{THEN**} 
(THEN** tactic1 tactic2) will first apply tactic1 to the current
goal.  If it does not fail, tactic2 will be applied to the goals which are
produced by tactic1, and success will be returned along with any new goals
produced.  If tactic1 fails, failure will be returned.  Differs from THEN
and THEN* in that the current goal will never be copied.

\item[TRY] \index{TRY} 
(TRY tactic) will use tactic on the current object.  If any goals
remain after tactic finishes, then the original object will be restored,
otherwise the work done by tactic will be kept.

\section{MS90-9 search procedure}

\begin{description} 
\item[MS90-9] \index{MS90-9} 
Begin mating search MS90-9 on the current expansion proof.
Primitive substitutions and duplications are performed systematically,
with multiple jforms being worked on simultaneously.  On each
particular jform, the search procedure MS90-3 is used.  The flags
MAX-SEARCH-LIMIT, SEARCH-TIME-LIMIT, and RANK-EPROOF-FN are used to
control the search.  See also the command SHOW-OPTION-TREE.
\item
\end{description}

\section{MS91-6 and MS91-7 search procedures}

\begin{description} 
\item[MS91-6] \index{MS91-6} 
Begin mating search MS91-6 on the current expansion proof.
Primitive substitutions and duplications are performed systematically,
with multiple jforms being worked on simultaneously.  On each
particular jform, the search procedure MS88 is used.  The flags
MAX-SEARCH-LIMIT and SEARCH-TIME-LIMIT are used to control the amount
of time spent on each jform.

The order in which the possible jforms are considered depends on a 
number of flags. Firstly, the primitive substitutions which are generated 
are determined by the values of MAX-PRIM-DEPTH, MIN-PRIM-DEPTH,
PRIM-QUANTIFIER and NEG-PRIM-SUB. If DUP-ALLOWED is T, then additional
options are generated corresponding to duplicated quantifiers. These
options are then combined into sets; because there can be many such sets,
the flag NEW-OPTION-SET-LIMIT controls how many are generated at once.
Each set is given a weighting (see flags WEIGHT-x-COEFFICIENT and 
WEIGHT-x-FN, for x = A,B,C), and the lowest-weighted set is chosen
for searching. If the weight of the lowest-weighted set is too large,
TPS may generate more sets; the interpretation of "too large" is given
by MS91-WEIGHT-LIMIT-RANGE. If the search fails, it will be discarded;
if it runs out of time then it will be re-weighted to be continued
later (see RECONSIDER-FN).

\item[MS91-7] \index{MS91-7} 
Begin mating search MS91-7 on the current expansion proof.
Primitive substitutions and duplications are performed systematically,
with multiple jforms being worked on simultaneously.  On each
particular jform, the search procedure MS90-3 is used.  The flags
MAX-SEARCH-LIMIT and SEARCH-TIME-LIMIT are used to control the amount
of time spent on each jform.

The order in which the possible jforms are considered depends on a 
number of flags. Firstly, the primitive substitutions which are generated 
are determined by the values of MAX-PRIM-DEPTH, MIN-PRIM-DEPTH,
PRIM-QUANTIFIER and NEG-PRIM-SUB. If DUP-ALLOWED is T, then additional
options are generated corresponding to duplicated quantifiers. These
options are then combined into sets; because there can be many such sets,
the flag NEW-OPTION-SET-LIMIT controls how many are generated at once.
Each set is given a weighting (see flags WEIGHT-x-COEFFICIENT and 
WEIGHT-x-FN, for x = A,B,C), and the lowest-weighted set is chosen
for searching. If the weight of the lowest-weighted set is too large,
TPS may generate more sets; the interpretation of "too large" is given
by MS91-WEIGHT-LIMIT-RANGE. If the search fails, it will be discarded;
if it runs out of time then it will be re-weighted to be continued
later (see RECONSIDER-FN).

\end{description}

\section{MS92-9 search procedure}

\begin{description} 
\item[MS92-9] \index{MS92-9} 
Call mating search procedure MS92-9 on the current eproof.  This
procedure uses a naive level-saturation method, exhaustively searching
a single jform before applying any duplications. Quantifier duplications
are applied uniformly to outermost quantifiers. Will try primitive
substitution for outermost variable only.  Works on only a single
jform at a time.
The procedure is almost identical to MS88, except that the flag
NUM-OF-DUPS is used to govern how many times the outermost quantifier
may be duplicated. The internal representation of variables is as in
MS90-3.
\item
\end{description}

\section{MS93-1 search procedure}

\begin{description} 
\item[MS93-1] \index{MS93-1} 
Begin mating search MS93-1 on the current expansion proof.
The search is basically identical to MS89, but is performed using the 
internal variable representations of MS90-9.
Primitive substitutions and duplications are performed systematically,
with multiple jforms being worked on simultaneously.  On each
particular jform, the search procedure MS92-9 is used.  The flags
MAX-SEARCH-LIMIT, SEARCH-TIME-LIMIT, and RANK-EPROOF-FN are used to
control the search. See also the command SHOW-OPTION-TREE.

\chapter{Matingstree Commands}
The internal name of this category is 
MTREEOP.\\
A matingstree command can be defined using DEFMTREEOP.
Allowable properties are: \texttt{MTREE-ALIAS}, \texttt{MTREE-MOVE}, \texttt{MTREE-PRINT}, \texttt{MTREE-DEFAULT}, \texttt{MTREE-ARGS}, \texttt{MHELP}.

\section{Top Levels}

\begin{description} 
\item[LEAVE] \index{LEAVE} 
leaving the mtree top level.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Mtree Operations}

\begin{description} 
\item[ADD-CONN] \index{ADD-CONN} 
Add a connection. The subsumption is considered.
The usage of the command is exactly as the usage of ADD-CONN in MATE.

\item[CHOOSE-BRANCH] \index{CHOOSE-BRANCH} 
Remove all matingstree branches except the one leading to the 
current matingstree node (which must be a leaf of the matingstree, and must
be complete). This will also do some preliminary merging, by deleting all 
of the jforms which are associated with the deleted nodes.

\item[COMPLETE-P] \index{COMPLETE-P} 
Check the completeness of the current mating. The usage of the command is 
exactly the same as the usage of the mate command COMPLETE-P.

\item[D] \index{D} 
Go down one level. D <nth> means go down along the nth subnode.
Counting begins from 0. Without argument, D means go down along the 
leftmost subnode.

\item[GOTO] \index{GOTO} 
GOTO <node> means to go to the given node. If <node> is not given,
it means to go to the root of the matingstree

\item[INIT] \index{INIT} 
Initialize the matingstree. This is done automatically 
when you enter the matingstree top level, but can be used 
subsequently to return everything to the state it was in when 
you first entered the mtree top level.

\item[KILL] \index{KILL} 
KILL <node> means to mark the given node and 
all nodes below it as dead.

\item[PICK] \index{PICK} 
Pick a leaf which you may try to mate with another later.
(MB: I think that PICK N behaves as though you had just 
added a connection to N, and generates the appropriate
obligations, without actually demanding another leaf to
connect with. I think.)

\item[PRUNE] \index{PRUNE} 
Remove all dead leaves below (but not including) 
the current matingstree.

\item[REM-NODE] \index{REM-NODE} 
Remove the last connection. The subsumption is considered.
If the node is the root, the whole matingstree is removed. The 
usage of the command is exactly the as the usage of REM-LAST-CONN. 
Please check the help message for REM-LAST-CONN if necessary.

\item[RESURRECT] \index{RESURRECT} 
RESURRECT <node> means to mark the given node and 
all nodes below it as alive.

\item[SHOW-MATING] \index{SHOW-MATING} 
Show the connections in the mating associated with the current node.

\item[SHOW-SUBSTS] \index{SHOW-SUBSTS} 
Show the substitution stack associated with a matingstree node.

\item[SIB] \index{SIB} 
Go to the next sibling of this node.

\item[UNIFY] \index{UNIFY} 
Go into UNIFY toplevel and check the UTREE structure
associated with the current node in the matingstree. The 
unification tree associated with the mating is passed on 
to the unification top-level. Any changes made to this tree 
are destructive. Applicable only for a higher-order unification 
problem. Mainly use to check the UTREE structure.

\item[UP] \index{UP} 
Go up one level.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Mtree Printing}

\begin{description} 
\item[CONNS-ADDED] \index{CONNS-ADDED} 
Print out all of the connections which have already 
been added to the given matingstree node. If no node
is given, the current node is used.

\item[LIVE-LEAVES] \index{LIVE-LEAVES} 
Print out all of the live leaves in the tree below 
the given matingstree node. If no node is given, the root 
node is used.

\item[PM-NODE] \index{PM-NODE} 
Print out the given matingstree node in detail. If no 
node is given, the current matingstree is used.

\item[PMTR] \index{PMTR} 
Print out the given matingstree as a tree, showing the obligations at each 
node. If no matingstree is given, the current-matingstree is printed out. 

Matingstrees enclosed in curly brackets are marked as dead.
Branches with *'s denote nodes that are being omitted for lack of space. The 
cure for this is to either start printing from a node lower in the tree, or 
make the screen wider. See also PMTR*.

\item[PMTR*] \index{PMTR*} 
Print out the given matingstree as a tree, showing the obligations at each 
node. If no matingstree is given, the current-matingstree is printed out. 

Numbers in round brackets are open obligations. If the brackets end in "..",
there are too many open obligations to fit under the mstree label. 

Leaves underlined with \textasciicircum 's are closed matingstrees. 
Matingstrees enclosed in curly brackets are marked as dead.
Branches with *'s denote nodes that are being omitted for lack of space. The 
cure for this is to either start printing from a node lower in the tree, or 
make the screen wider. See also PMTR.

\item[PMTR-FLAT] \index{PMTR-FLAT} 
Print out the given matingstree in a flat format. 
If no matingstree is given, the current matingstree is printed out.

\item[POB] \index{POB} 
Print out the vpform associated with the given obligation node.
If no obligation is specified, then the first open obligation 
in the current obligation tree is used. See the flag 
DEFAULT-OB-DEEP.

\item[POB-LITS] \index{POB-LITS} 
Print out the unblocked literals in a given obligation tree.
If no argument is given, the current-obligation tree is the default.

\item[POB-NODE] \index{POB-NODE} 
Print out the given obligation in detail. If no 
obligation is given, then the first open obligation 
in the current obligation tree is used. See the flag 
DEFAULT-OB-DEEP.

\item[POTR] \index{POTR} 
Print out the given obligation tree as a tree. If no obligation is given,
the tree below the current obligation is printed out. 

Numbers in round brackets are open obligations; those in square brackets are
closed. 
Branches with *'s denote nodes that are being omitted for lack of space.
The cure for this is to either start printing from a node lower in the tree,
or make the screen wider.

\item[POTR*-FLAT] \index{POTR*-FLAT} 
Print out the given obligation tree in flat form, 
with the jforms attached to all nodes. If no argument is given,
the whole obligation tree is printed out.

\item[POTR-FLAT] \index{POTR-FLAT} 
Print out the given obligation tree in flat form, 
with the jforms attached to the leaves. If no argument is 
given, the current-obligation tree is printed out.

\item[PPATH] \index{PPATH} 
Print out the path containing the given obligation.
If no obligation is specified, then the first open obligation 
in the current obligation tree is used. See the flag 
DEFAULT-OB-DEEP.

\item[PPATH*] \index{PPATH*} 
Print out the path containing the given obligation,
and show all of the obligations on this path.
If no obligation is specified, then the first open obligation 
in the current obligation tree is used. See the flag 
DEFAULT-OB-DEEP.

\section{Mtree Auto}

\begin{description} 
\item[ADD-ALL-LIT] \index{ADD-ALL-LIT} 
Attempt to mate a literal with all potential mates on 
the current path.

Attempt to mate all literals in an obligation 
with all potential mates on the current path.

\item[EXPAND-LEAVES] \index{EXPAND-LEAVES} 
Apply ADD-ALL-OB to all live leaves of the current matingstree
that lie below the given node (or the current node, if no node is given).
WARNING: Potential combinatorial explosion!

\item[GO] \index{GO} 
Call the matingstree procedure given in DEFAULT-MS.

\item[MT94-11] \index{MT94-11} 
Apply EXPAND-LEAVES repeatedly to all live leaves of the current 
matingstree that lie below the given node (or the current node, if 
no node is given), until a closed leaf is generated.
WARNING: Potential combinatorial explosion!

\item[MT94-12] \index{MT94-12} 
Least Branching Search: In each leaf node, take the current
obligation and find a literal that can be mated, but with as few 
mates as possible. Add all of these mates as sons to this node.
Repeat until a closed leaf is generated.
This search is probably not complete.

\item[MT95-1] \index{MT95-1} 
Fewest Obligations Search: Choose the matingstree node (from the 
entire tree, not just the tree below the current node) with the 
fewest open obligations. Go to that node and do one step of MT94-12
(i.e. choose the literal with the fewest number of mates, and generate
all of the associated branches of the mtree).
Repeat until a closed leaf is generated.
This search is probably not complete.

\item[QRY] \index{QRY} 
Output a list of literals which can be mated with a given literal.

\chapter{Unification Commands}
The internal name of this category is 
UNIFOP.\\
An unification command can be defined using DEFUNIFOP.
Allowable properties are: \texttt{UNIF-ARGTYPES}, \texttt{UNIF-ARGNAMES}, \texttt{UNIF-ARGHELP}, \texttt{UNIF-DEFAULTFNS}, \texttt{UNIF-APPLICABLEP}, \texttt{UNIF-MAINFNS}, \texttt{PRINT-COMMAND}, \texttt{MOVE-COMMAND}, \texttt{MHELP}.

\section{Top Levels}

\begin{description} 
\item[LEAVE] \index{LEAVE} 
Exit unification.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Unification}

\begin{description} 
\item[0] \index{0} 
Replace the current topnode with the node on top of the nodestack.
Generally, typing an integer n will go to the nth son of the current
node. Compare the command NTH-SON.

\item[APPLY-SUBST] \index{APPLY-SUBST} 
Apply a substitution, suggested by the user, to the current topnode.
Modifies the unification tree.

\item[EPROOF-UTREE] \index{EPROOF-UTREE} 
Create a new utree whose root has all the dpairs
associated with the current mating. (The existing utree may
have some of the dpairs added lower down the tree; this will
bring them all to the top). See also NAME-DPAIR.

\item[GO] \index{GO} 
Call unification in automatic mode. Will search for unifiers
only below the current-topnode.

\item[GOTO] \index{GOTO} 
Go to the specified node in the unification tree.

\item[MATCH] \index{MATCH} 
This command is applicable only if current-topnode is a non-terminal
leaf node. Calls TPS's version of Huet's MATCH algorithm to find substitutions
at the current topnode. The pair selected by MATCH is determined by the value 
of the flag APPLY-MATCH.

\item[MATCH-PAIR] \index{MATCH-PAIR} 
This command is applicable only if current-topnode is a non-terminal
leaf node. Calls TPS's version of Huet's MATCH algorithm to find 
substitutions at the current topnode. n refers to the nth dpair, 
and this must be a flexible-rigid dpair.

\item[NAME-DPAIR] \index{NAME-DPAIR} 
Give a name to the dpairset associated with the current topnode.
This is most useful when UNIFY has been issued from the MATE top
level, and you want to name the current dpair so that you can save
it in the library. See also EPROOF-UTREE.

\item[NTH-SON] \index{NTH-SON} 
Go to the nth descendant of the current-topnode. Instead of
using this command, you can simply type n on the unification top level to
go to the nth descendant. It has no effect if the current-topnode has
no descendents.

\item[P] \index{P} 
Displays the current unification node; show its name,
measure, number of descendants, substitutions added and free
variables. Does not display the disagreement pairs (use PP or
PP* for that), or the cumulative substitutions from this node 
to the root (use SUBST-STACK for that).

\item[PALL] \index{PALL} 
Displays all the disagreement pairs at every node below the
given node. (Similar to PP, but for the entire tree below the current
node.)

\item[PP] \index{PP} 
Displays the disagreement pairs at the current node. See also PP*. 
More information about the current node is given by the command P.

\item[PP*] \index{PP*} 
Displays the disagreement pairs at the current-topnode, including the order of
each pair and other information. See also PP. The other information displayed
includes (for each wff, each disagreement pair and the whole set of 
disagreement pairs):
1) the order (e.g. "x(i)" is first order, and so on).
2) whether it is monadic (all function constants are unary).
3) whether it is linear (all free vars occur once only).
4) whether it is a matching problem (one side of a dpair has no free vars).
5) whether it is a relaxed pattern (all free vars have only bound vars as
   arguments).
6) whether it is a pattern (all free vars have distinct bound vars as 
   arguments).
7) whether a disagreement pair is variable-disjoint (the free vars on the
   left are disjoint from those on the right).
8) whether the set of disagreement pairs can be partitioned into sets in 
   which each free var in the whole problem occurs in at most one set.
9) whether there are any free vars that occur only once, or not at all, in 
   the whole problem.
These conditions all appear in the literature on higher-order unification; 
see, for example, Prehofer's paper in CADE '94.

More information about the current node is given by the command P.

\item[SIMPLIFY] \index{SIMPLIFY} 
A call to TPS's version of Huet's SIMPL algorithm. Dpairs in the 
current topnode are replaced by the dpairs returned by the call. It will 
also find substitutions of the form (var . term) provided `var' does not
occur in `term'. This command will alter the unification tree.

\item[STATS] \index{STATS} 
Statistics about the current unification tree.

\item[SUBST-STACK] \index{SUBST-STACK} 
Displays the substitution stack for the current topnode.
See also P, PP, PP* for other information about the current node.

\item[UTREE] \index{UTREE} 
Displays the unification tree and the associated substitutions at
each node which is below the specified node. Display is in a flat
format; UTREE* prints the same information in a tree format.

\item[UTREE*] \index{UTREE*} 
Displays the unification tree and the associated substitutions at
each node which is below the specified node. Display is in a tree
format; UTREE prints the same information in a flat format. Display 
shows nodes as numbers, followed by I for imitation, P for projection,
~ for negation, A for administrative (e.g. anything generated by SIMPL).
Optionally shows the most recent substitution on the subst-stack at 
each node.

\item[\textasciicircum ] \index{\textasciicircum } 
Go to the parent node of the current-topnode.
(i.e. move up one level in the tree).

\item[\textasciicircum \textasciicircum ] \index{\textasciicircum \textasciicircum } 
Go to the root node in the unification tree 
(the node with name "0").
\item
\end{description}

\section{Dpairs}

\begin{description} 
\item[ADD-DPAIR] \index{ADD-DPAIR} 
If the disagreement set already exists, insert a disagreement pair at
the front. Else create a new disagreement set consisting of this dpair only.

\item[ADD-DPAIRS-TO-NODE] \index{ADD-DPAIRS-TO-NODE} 
Add new dpairs to the disagreement set at the CURRENT-TOPNODE. Applicable 
only if CURRENT-TOPNODE is a non failure leaf node. `Name', the first argument 
to this command must already represent a disagreement set. Use the command 
ADD-DPAIR,etc., to create this set.

\item[ADD-DPAIRS-TO-UTREE] \index{ADD-DPAIRS-TO-UTREE} 
Add new dpairs at all non failure leaf nodes.

\item[FIND-NESTING] \index{FIND-NESTING} 
Find the values for MAX-SUBSTS-* implied by
the current node.

\item[PRUNE] \index{PRUNE} 
Prune all the branches which have either reached the maximum
allowed depth, or which end only in failure nodes.

\item[RM-DPAIR] \index{RM-DPAIR} 
Remove a disagreement pair from a disagreement set.

\item[SHOW-DPAIRSET] \index{SHOW-DPAIRSET} 
Show a disagreement set.

\item[UNIF-PROBLEM] \index{UNIF-PROBLEM} 
Set up a new unification problem. `Name', the first argument to this 
command must already represent a disagreement set. Use the command ADD-DPAIR
to create this set. This is in some ways the inverse of the NAME-DPAIR 
command.

\chapter{Test-Top Commands}
The internal name of this category is 
TESTCMD.\\
A test-top command can be defined using DEFTEST.
Allowable properties are: \texttt{TEST-ARGTYPES}, \texttt{TEST-ARGNAMES}, \texttt{TEST-ARGHELP}, \texttt{TEST-DEFAULTFNS}, \texttt{TEST-MAINFNS}, \texttt{MHELP}.

\section{Top Levels}

\begin{description} 
\item[LEAVE] \index{LEAVE} 
Leave TEST-TOP to the next enclosing top level.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Mating search}

\begin{description} 
\item[BREADTH-FIRST-SEARCH] \index{BREADTH-FIRST-SEARCH} 
Equivalent to setting TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN to BREADTH-FIRST-SEARCH
and then typing GO. Permanently changes TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN.

\item[CLOSE-TESTWIN] \index{CLOSE-TESTWIN} 
Closes the window that displays the test-top summary.
Use ..../tps/utilities/vpshow (from a shell, not from TPS) 
to view the output file again.

\item[CONTINUE] \index{CONTINUE} 
Continue searching with current searchlist \&  current problem
(similar to GO, but will continue from the last point reached rather
than restarting at the beginning again).

\item[EXHAUSTIVE-SEARCH] \index{EXHAUSTIVE-SEARCH} 
Equivalent to setting TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN to EXHAUSTIVE-SEARCH
and then typing GO. Permanently changes TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN.

\item[FIND-BEST-MODE] \index{FIND-BEST-MODE} 
This command effectively runs PUSH-UP until it finds
a mode that works, and then runs PRESS-DOWN until it finds the
best mode it can.
Before using this command, use the MODE command to 
set up a mode in which the current theorem can not be proven. Also
check the value of the TEST-INCREASE-TIME flag (it should probably
not be zero).
Then PUSH-UP will systematically vary the values of the flags
listed in the TEST-EASIER-IF-* flags, using the PUSH-UP search
function (see the help message for TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN).
Once a correct mode is discovered, it will systematically vary
the values of the flags listed in the TEST-FASTER-IF-* flags,
using the PRESS-DOWN search function, until it finds as good a 
mode as it can.
The values of TEST-REDUCE-TIME, TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN, 
TEST-INCREASE-TIME and TEST-FIX-UNIF-DEPTHS will be permanently
changed.

\item[GO] \index{GO} 
Start searching with current searchlist \&  current problem.

\item[OPEN-TESTWIN] \index{OPEN-TESTWIN} 
Open a window which will display a summary of the test-top output.
The window can be closed with the command CLOSE-TESTWIN. The size 
of the text is determined by the flag CHARSIZE, and the current width of the window 
by the flag TESTWIN-WIDTH. The initial height of the window is determined by 
TESTWIN-HEIGHT.

\item[PRESS-DOWN] \index{PRESS-DOWN} 
Before using this command, use the MODE command to 
set up a mode in which the current theorem can be proven. Also
check the value of the TEST-INITIAL-TIME-LIMIT flag (it should
be high enough that the first attempt at proof will succeed).
Then PRESS-DOWN will systematically vary the values of the flags
listed in the TEST-FASTER-IF-* flags, using the PRESS-DOWN search
function (see the help message for TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN).
The values of TEST-REDUCE-TIME, TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN and 
TEST-FIX-UNIF-DEPTHS will be permanently changed (to T, PRESS-DOWN
and T respectively).

Note that this is NOT the same as PRESS-DOWN-2, since it automatically
generates a searchlist rather than relying on the user to provide one.

\item[PRESS-DOWN-2] \index{PRESS-DOWN-2} 
Equivalent to setting TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN to PRESS-DOWN-2
and then typing GO. Permanently changes TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN.
Note that this is NOT the same as typing PRESS-DOWN; this will
use the user-defined searchlist rather than an automatically
generated one.

\item[PUSH-UP] \index{PUSH-UP} 
This command effectively runs PUSH-UP until it finds
a mode that works, and then stops.
Before using this command, use the MODE command to 
set up a mode in which the current theorem can not be proven. Also
check the value of the TEST-INCREASE-TIME flag (it should probably
not be zero).
Then PUSH-UP will systematically vary the values of the flags
listed in the TEST-EASIER-IF-* flags, using the PUSH-UP search
function (see the help message for TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN).
The value of TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN will be changed to PUSH-UP.

Note that this is NOT the same as PUSH-UP-2, since it automatically
generates a searchlist rather than relying on the user to provide one

\item[PUSH-UP-2] \index{PUSH-UP-2} 
Equivalent to setting TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN to PUSH-UP-2
and then typing GO. Permanently changes TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN.
Note that this is NOT the same as typing PUSH-UP; this will
use the user-defined searchlist rather than an automatically
generated one.

\item[SEARCH-ORDER] \index{SEARCH-ORDER} 
Show the order in which things will be changed if the search is
started now using the given searchlist.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Searchlists}

\begin{description} 
\item[ADD-FLAG] \index{ADD-FLAG} 
Add a single flag to the current searchlist.
To change the current searchlist, use NEW-SEARCHLIST.

\item[ADD-FLAG*] \index{ADD-FLAG*} 
Repeatedly add new flags to the current searchlist.

\item[ADD-FUNCTION] \index{ADD-FUNCTION} 
Add a function to a searchlist. This function will be evaluated on 
every iteration of the search, and will generally reset certain flags.
The special functions defined so far are:
UNIFORM-SEARCH-FUNCTION sets max-utree-depth, max-search-limit and max-substs-quick
using the values of max-search-depth, search-time-limit and max-substs-var respectively,
and then sets TEST-INITIAL-TIME-LIMIT to allow 5 option sets on the first try, then
10, then 15, and so on.
BASIC-SEARCH-THEN-UNIFORM-SEARCH runs the current searchlist once over, allowing
1 hour for each setting of the flags. Then it switches the searchlist to
UNIFORM-SEARCH-2 and continues with that.

\item[ADD-SUBJECTS] \index{ADD-SUBJECTS} 
Add all the flags concerning the given subjects to the current 
searchlist.

\item[NEW-SEARCHLIST] \index{NEW-SEARCHLIST} 
Make a new searchlist; i.e. begin a new list of flags to be varied.
This command also changes the current searchlist.

\item[QUICK-DEFINE] \index{QUICK-DEFINE} 
Define a searchlist the quick and dirty way!
If the current flag settings are OK (i.e. are a successful mode),
will create a searchlist in which the flags given in the values of 
the TEST-FASTER-* flags (do LIST TEST-TOP for a listing) vary over 
values which ought to give a faster search than the current values.
If the current flag settings are not OK, will create a searchlist in 
which the flags given in the values of the TEST-EASIER-* flags vary
over values which ought to make the search easier than the current 
values.
The maximum number of values for any flag to take is governed 
by TEST-MAX-SEARCH-VALUES.

\item[REM-FLAG] \index{REM-FLAG} 
Remove a single flag from the current searchlist.
To change the current searchlist, use NEW-SEARCHLIST.

\item[REM-FLAG*] \index{REM-FLAG*} 
Repeatedly remove flags from the current searchlist.

\item[REVISE-DEFAULTS] \index{REVISE-DEFAULTS} 
For each flag in the given searchlist, change the default setting to 
the current value of the flag, and put the default setting into the range
(unless it's already there). This is useful in conjunction with SCALE-UP 
and SCALE-DOWN; you can keep one searchlist (let's call it MASTER-SLIST) 
containing all of the flags you're likely to want to vary. Then if the 
current flag settings are a good mode and you want to try and find a better 
one, do REVISE-DEFAULTS followed by SCALE-DOWN MASTER-SLIST; if the current
settings are a bad mode and you want to try to find one that works, do 
REVISE-DEFAULTS followed by SCALE-UP MASTER-SLIST.

\item[SCALE-DOWN] \index{SCALE-DOWN} 
Rewrites a searchlist under the assumption that the initial
values in the searchlist (together with appropriate settings of the other
flags) constitute a successful mode, and that TEST is being run in order 
to find a faster mode. This will discard all settings that would make the
search slower, and will arrange the range of values in such a way that the
bounds of the search will gradually decrease until the proof cannot be 
completed. If this makes the range empty or a singleton, the flag is removed
from the searchlist. See the TEST-FASTER-* flags

\item[SCALE-UP] \index{SCALE-UP} 
Rewrites a searchlist under the assumption that the initial
values in the searchlist (together with appropriate settings of the other
flags) do not constitute a successful mode, and that TEST is being run in order
to find a mode that works. This will discard all settings that would make the 
search harder, and will arrange the range of values in such a way that the 
bounds of the search will gradually increase until the proof (with a bit of 
luck) can be completed. If this makes the range empty or a singleton, the flag 
is removed from the searchlist. See the TEST-EASIER-* flags.

\item[SEARCHLISTS] \index{SEARCHLISTS} 
Print a list of all searchlists currently in memory.

\item[SHOW-SEARCHLIST] \index{SHOW-SEARCHLIST} 
Show contents of a searchlist.

\item[VARY-MODE] \index{VARY-MODE} 
Go through an existing mode, flag by flag, creating a searchlist
by picking out relevant flags from it. All useless flags (i.e. ones that 
cannot affect the search time) will be automatically stripped out. The
default flag value in the searchlist will be its value in the mode.
You can also optionally set the current flag values to the values 
in the mode (equivalent to the MODE command).

\section{Library}

\begin{description} 
\item[DELETE] \index{DELETE} 
Delete a saved searchlist or mode (equivalent to the library
command DELETE.

searchlist in the library. Will also save a mode that has been found 
by using GO.

\chapter{Models Commands}
The internal name of this category is 
MODELSCMD.\\
A models command can be defined using DEFMODELS.
Allowable properties are: \texttt{MODELS-ARGTYPES}, \texttt{MODELS-ARGNAMES}, \texttt{MODELS-ARGHELP}, \texttt{MODELS-DEFAULTFNS}, \texttt{MODELS-MAINFNS}, \texttt{MHELP}.

\section{Top Levels}

\begin{description} 
\item[LEAVE] \index{LEAVE} 
Leave MODELS to the next enclosing top level.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Printing}

\begin{description} 
\item[PELT] \index{PELT} 
Print the integer in notation appropriate to the given type.
For example, elements of type (OA) are printed in set notation.
The empty set is called EMPTY and the universal set is called FULL.

Constant functions are denoted by Kc.

A few special cases are T and F at type O, NOT at type (OO),
the binary connectives AND, OR, IMPLIES, EQUIV and XOR at type (OOO),
PI and SIGMA at types of the form (O(OA)),
= at types of the form (OAA) and 
ID at types of the form (AA).

EMPTY at a type (OA) corresponds to the empty set.

FULL at a type (OA) corresponds to the set of all elements of type A.

PI at a type (O(OA)) corresponds to the singleton {FULL} where FULL 
corresponds to the set of all elements of type A.

SIGMA at a type (O(OA)) corresponds to the set containing all sets of
type A except EMPTY.

For elements of low types the command PELT-REC may also be helpful.

SEE ALSO: PELT-REC

\item[PELT-REC] \index{PELT-REC} 
Print the integer in notation appropriate to the given type.
For example, elements of type (OA) are printed in set notation.
The empty set is called EMPTY and the universal set is called FULL.

Constant functions are denoted by K(c).

A few special cases are T and F at type O, NOT at type (OO), 
the binary connectives AND, OR, IMPLIES, EQUIV and XOR at type (OOO),
PI and SIGMA at types of the form (O(OA)),
= at types of the form (OAA) and 
ID at types of the form (AA).

EMPTY at a type (OA) corresponds to the empty set.

FULL at a type (OA) corresponds to the set of all elements of type A.

PI at a type (O(OA)) corresponds to the singleton {FULL} where FULL 
corresponds to the set of all elements of type A.

SIGMA at a type (O(OA)) corresponds to the set containing all sets of
type A except EMPTY.

This command is recursive.  For low types this is helpful, but
the notation becomes unwieldy for higher types.  For higher types
the command PELT is more appropriate.

\section{Saving Wffs}

\begin{description} 
\item[SAVE] \index{SAVE} 
Save a wff by appending it to the file SAVEDWFFS. The 
weak label name should not already exist (if it does, remove it
using RW). The wffs that are saved to this file can be reloaded
using the command QLOAD "savedwffs.lisp".
  This command dates from before the LIBRARY top level was 
introduced; you should probably avoid it. If you want to save 
a gwff, use CW to create a weak label, then go into the library
with LIB and use INSERT to save the wff.
\item

\section{Top Levels}

\begin{description} 
\item[LEAVE] \index{LEAVE} 
Leave LIBRARY to the next enclosing top level.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Display}

\begin{description} 
\item[KEY] \index{KEY} 
Search for a string in the names of all library objects. If
the given string is also a keyword (see SHOW-KEYWORDS), then the keywords
for each library object will also be searched. This command does not search
the help messages of library objects.

\item[LIBFILES] \index{LIBFILES} 
Lists all library files in the current default directories,
or in a single chosen directory.

\item[LIBOBJECTS-IN-FILE] \index{LIBOBJECTS-IN-FILE} 
Lists the contents of a file.

If more than one file of the given name is found in the library directories
in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR, the user is prompted to choose one.

\item[LIST-OF-LIBOBJECTS] \index{LIST-OF-LIBOBJECTS} 
List all objects or all objects of specified TYPE.

\item[SCRIBE-ALL-WFFS] \index{SCRIBE-ALL-WFFS} 
Write all wffs in all files in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR (and optionally BACKUP-LIB-DIR)
to an mss file.
The three verbosity settings are: MIN, which just shows the names of the 
objects, MED, which shows the help messages, keywords, provability and wffs 
as well, and MAX, which shows everything. 
As a filter, you can select any known keywords; only the wffs which 
satisfy all of the given keywords will be shown. See SHOW-KEYWORDS 
for a list of keywords.

\item[SCRIBELIBDIR] \index{SCRIBELIBDIR} 
Print all the library files in a given directory into 
MSS files. See SCRIBELIBFILE for details.

\item[SCRIBELIBFILE] \index{SCRIBELIBFILE} 
Print the specified library files into MSS files.
The three verbosity settings are: MIN, which just shows the names of the 
objects, MED, which shows the help messages, keywords, provability and wffs 
as well, and MAX, which shows everything. It can take a list of filenames and 
a corresponding list of output files; if the latter list is too long it will 
be truncated, and if it is too short then the last filename given will be used 
for all the remaining output (so you can write a group of library files to a 
single output file by only supplying one output filename).  
After leaving TPS, run the .mss files through Scribe and print the resulting
files.

Some files in the list of library files may be ambiguous, in the 
sense that more than one file of the given name exists in the 
library directories in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR.  
In this case, the user is prompted to disambiguate each ambiguous
filename from first to last.

\item[SEARCH] \index{SEARCH} 
Search the entire library, including all comments, for any one
of a given list of strings, and return the names of all objects which
contain such a string. This is useful for finding out, for example,
which gwffs can be proven using either MS88 or MS89.
WARNING: THIS COMMAND IS SLOW, AND CAN USE A LOT OF MEMORY.
You might want to think about using the Unix "grep" command instead.

\item[SEARCH2] \index{SEARCH2} 
Search the entire library, including all comments, for a 
given combination of strings. See also SEARCH.
The syntax for the given list is essentially conjunctive normal
form -- it should be a list of conjuncts, each of which is a list of 
disjuncts.
For example:
((MS88) (THM)) finds everything containing THM and MS88
((MS88 THM)) finds everything containing THM or MS88
((MS88 MS89) (THM EXERCISE)) finds everything containing (MS88 or MS89)
                             and (THM or EXERCISE).
WARNING: THIS COMMAND IS SLOW, AND CAN USE A LOT OF MEMORY.
You might want to think about using the Unix "grep" command instead.

\item[SHOW] \index{SHOW} 
Display a library object.

If more than one library object of this name is stored in
the library and SHOW-ALL-LIBOBJECTS is set to T,
the user is prompted to disambiguate.

\item[SHOW*-WFF] \index{SHOW*-WFF} 
Display the wff of a gwff in the library, with the associated
help message, keywords and provability status.
Also shows any needed objects, such as the definition and
help for abbrevations used in the gwff.

\item[SHOW-ALL-WFFS] \index{SHOW-ALL-WFFS} 
Show all wffs in all files in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR (and optionally BACKUP-LIB-DIR).
As a filter, you can select any known keywords; only the wffs which 
satisfy all of the given keywords will be shown. See SHOW-KEYWORDS 
for a list of keywords.

\item[SHOW-HELP] \index{SHOW-HELP} 
Display the help message associated with a library object.

If more than one library object of this name is stored in
the library and SHOW-ALL-LIBOBJECTS is set to T,
the user is prompted to disambiguate.

\item[SHOW-OBJECTS-IN-FILE] \index{SHOW-OBJECTS-IN-FILE} 
Lists all the objects of the given type (or types) in a file.

If more than one file of the given name is found in the library directories
in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR, the user is prompted to choose one.

\item[SHOW-TIMING] \index{SHOW-TIMING} 
Display the timing information of a gwff in the library.
NOTE: Will only display timing information that has been recorded 
in standard DATEREC format.
If you opt for output to go to a file as well as to the screen, 
the format of the file will be SCRIBE or TEX if this is the current
value of the STYLE flag, and GENERIC otherwise.

\item[SHOW-WFF] \index{SHOW-WFF} 
Display the wff of a gwff in the library.

If more than one library object of this name is stored in
the library and SHOW-ALL-LIBOBJECTS is set to T,
the user is prompted to disambiguate.

\item[SHOW-WFF\& HELP] \index{SHOW-WFF\& HELP} 
Display the wff of a gwff in the library, with the associated
help message, keywords and provability status.

\item[SHOW-WFFS-IN-FILE] \index{SHOW-WFFS-IN-FILE} 
Lists the wffs in a file.

\item[TEX-ALL-WFFS] \index{TEX-ALL-WFFS} 
Write all wffs in all files in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR (and optionally BACKUP-LIB-DIR)
to a TeX file. 
The three verbosity settings are: MIN, which just shows the names of the 
objects, MED, which shows the help messages, provability and wffs as well, and MAX, 
which shows everything.
As a filter, you can select any known keywords; only the wffs which 
satisfy all of the given keywords will be shown. See SHOW-KEYWORDS 
for a list of keywords.

\item[TEXLIBDIR] \index{TEXLIBDIR} 
Print all the library files in a given directory into 
TEX files. See TEXLIBFILE for details.

\item[TEXLIBFILE] \index{TEXLIBFILE} 
Print the specified library files into TeX files.
The three verbosity settings are: MIN, which just shows the names of the 
objects, MED, which shows the help messages, keywords, provability and wffs 
as well, and MAX, which shows everything. It can take a list of filenames 
and a corresponding list of output files; if the latter list is too long it 
will be truncated, and if it is too short then the last filename given will 
be used for all the remaining output (so you can write a group of library 
files to a single output file by only supplying one output filename).  
After leaving TPS, run the .tex files through TeX and print the resulting
files.

\section{Reading}

\begin{description} 
\item[DESTROY] \index{DESTROY} 
Remove a library object from TPS (the object will remain
stored in the library).

\item[FETCH] \index{FETCH} 
Make a library object available in TPS.
Will create a new TPS object if EXPERTFLAG is set to T, otherwise
will create a weak label for the new library object.

If more than one library object of this name is stored in
the library and SHOW-ALL-LIBOBJECTS is set to T,
the user is prompted to disambiguate.

\item[FIND-PROVABLE] \index{FIND-PROVABLE} 
Look for gwffs with a certain provability status.

\item[RESTORE-MASTERINDEX] \index{RESTORE-MASTERINDEX} 
Restore library master index. Normally this need not be done by the
user as it is done automatically when TPS is first entered. However, if
the contents of the library may have been changed from outside of TPS
(e.g. by a text editor) since TPS was started, then this command will
re-initialize the library index.

\item[RETRIEVE-FILE] \index{RETRIEVE-FILE} 
Make all objects in a library file available in TPS. Objects in a
file are retrieved in the same order as they are stored in the file.

If more than one file of the given name is found in the library directories
in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR, the user is prompted to choose one.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Library Structure}

\begin{description} 
\item[COPY-LIBDIR] \index{COPY-LIBDIR} 
COPY-LIBDIR can be used to copy a library directory into a
new library directory which TPS will automatically create,
or it can be used to copy the contents of a library directory into
an existing library directory.  If COPY-LIBDIR is copying into
an existing directory, and an object of the same name and type
exists in both the source and destination directory, the original
object remains in the destination directory instead of being overwritten.
The user has the option of omitting the other-remarks property
of the library objects.  If any needed-objects are left over,
the user is given the option of copying these extra needed-objects
into a new library file in the destination library directory.

COPY-LIBDIR will also copy the bestmodes and keywords files, if they
exist.  If the target directory already has a bestmodes or keywords
file, then the corresponding files will be merged.

\item[COPY-LIBFILE] \index{COPY-LIBFILE} 
Copy a file of library objects. The source file will
be found among the directories in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR
(the user will be prompted if more than one such file exists, and also
if there is a choice of directories for the new file).
Needed objects are not copied.

\item[CREATE-LIB-DIR] \index{CREATE-LIB-DIR} 
Create a directory to store files containing library items.
This will not only create the directory, but create a file libindex.rec
so that TPS will recognize the directory as a library directory.
This command can be executed for the latter purpose even if the
directory already exists. 
This command will automatically add the directory to DEFAULT-LIB-DIR in
the current session of TPS.

\item[CREATE-LIB-SUBDIR] \index{CREATE-LIB-SUBDIR} 
Creates a subdirectory of a current library directory
in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR to store files containing library items.
This will not only create the directory, but also creates a
LIB-MASTERINDEX-FILE so that TPS will recognize the directory as a 
library directory.  This command will also add the subdirectory to
DEFAULT-LIB-DIR.  TPS automatically looks for subdirectories when setting
DEFAULT-LIB-DIR, so there is no need to add the subdirectory to
the DEFAULT-LIB-DIR setting in the tps3.ini file.

\item[DELETE-LIB-DIR] \index{DELETE-LIB-DIR} 
Deletes a library directory and removes it from DEFAULT-LIB-DIR.
The command will fail if the directory contains any library objects
(i.e., if the index file is not empty).

\item[DELETE-LIBFILE] \index{DELETE-LIBFILE} 
Delete a Library File

\item[MOVE-LIBFILE] \index{MOVE-LIBFILE} 
Move a file of library objects. The source file will
be found among the directories in DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR
(the user will be prompted if more than one such file exists, and also
if there is a choice of directories for the new file).
Needed objects are not moved.

\item[RENAME-LIBDIR] \index{RENAME-LIBDIR} 
Rename a Library Directory

\item[RENAME-LIBFILE] \index{RENAME-LIBFILE} 
Rename a Library File (within the same library directory)

\item[UPDATE-LIBDIR] \index{UPDATE-LIBDIR} 
UPDATE-LIBDIR can be used to update a (common) library directory
by copying any object from a directory DEFAULT-LIB-DIR or BACKUP-LIB-DIR
into the (common) library directory, if it is not already there.
Before updating from a library directory, the user is asked whether
to update from this directory.  This is so one can choose a collection
of library directories to combine into the common destination directory.

This has the same effect of 

1. calling COPY-LIBDIR with copying from each (chosen) directory in
DEFAULT-LIB-DIR and BACKUP-LIB-DIR into the (common) destination
library directory.

2. Calling IMPORT-NEEDED-OBJECTS to ensure all needed-objects
are also put into the destination directory.

If one wants to get the latest version of all library items,
specify the complete pathname of a nonexistent directory when 
TPS prompts for a destination directory.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Editing}

\begin{description} 
\item[ADD-GOODMODES] \index{ADD-GOODMODES} 
Add modes to a list of goodmodes.  Also, add theorems that these goodmodes can prove.

\item[CHANGE-PROVABILITY] \index{CHANGE-PROVABILITY} 
Change the PROVABILITY attribute of a stored gwff.

If more than one library object of this name is stored in
the library and SHOW-ALL-LIBOBJECTS is set to T,
the user is prompted to disambiguate.

\item[CHECK-NEEDED-OBJECTS] \index{CHECK-NEEDED-OBJECTS} 
Checks for library objects which are not stored
in the chosen directory, but are needed by some object in
that directory.

\item[COPY-LIBOBJECT] \index{COPY-LIBOBJECT} 
Copy an object from some specified directory to the default directory.
Does not copy the library entries of needed objects.

If more than one library object of this name is stored in
the library and SHOW-ALL-LIBOBJECTS is set to T,
the user is prompted to disambiguate.

\item[DELETE] \index{DELETE} 
Delete an object from the library.

If more than one library object of this name is stored in
the library, the user is prompted to disambiguate.

\item[FIX-MODES] \index{FIX-MODES} 
Change all references to obsolete flags into the 
appropriate new flag setting, for every mode in your library
directory. You only need to do this once.
You will be prompted before anything is changed, and
you should probably keep a backup copy of your old library in
case disaster strikes!
THE CODE FOR THIS COMMAND SHOULD BE REWRITTEN FOR EACH 
RELEVANT CHANGE TO THE TPS FLAGS.
At the minute, it's set up to remove references to 
REWRITE-DEFNS-EAGER, REWRITE-EQUAL-EXT and REWRITE-ONLY-EXT,
which have been removed, and to reset REWRITE-DEFNS
and REWRITE-EQUALITIES to appropriate values.
It also puts LAST-MODE-NAME at the head of all settings
for RECORDFLAGS.

\item[IMPORT-NEEDED-OBJECTS] \index{IMPORT-NEEDED-OBJECTS} 
Copies library objects which are not stored
in the chosen directory, but are needed by some object in
that directory, into the directory.  If there is a choice
of objects to import, and SHOW-ALL-LIBOBJECTS is set to T,
then the user is prompted to choose one.

\item[INSERT] \index{INSERT} 
Insert an item in the library. 
The INSERT command can be used to create a new library object or
to modify existing entries in the library.  If SHOW-ALL-LIBOBJECTS
is set to T, the user is prompted to indicate which existing
library object to modify or which library directory into which
the new object should be inserted. If AUTO-KEYWORDS is set to T, 
executing INSERT-LIBOBJECT requires expanding all definitions, 
which can take an enormous amount of time when definitions are 
deeply nested.

All the items will be replaced by whatever you write
(or kept the same if you use the default) except for "additional
remarks"; what you specify here will be added to whatever is already
there. If you don't want to add additional remarks, respond with
<space><return>. Use your favorite editor to make any changes within
the existing comment.

\item[INSERT-TPTP] \index{INSERT-TPTP} 
Insert a TPTP Problem into the library. 
The INSERT-TPTP command can be used to create a new library file 
containing abbreviations and theorems from a TPTP formatted file 
(.tps file). The destination directory is set according to the flag
AUTO-LIB-DIR. It will not overwrite or delete any existing items: 
new items need to have different names, hence the suffix.

\item[INSERT-TPTP*] \index{INSERT-TPTP*} 
For each TPTP Problem in the source directory, insert 
a new file into the library. The INSERT-TPTP* command can be used 
to create new library files containing abbreviations and theorems 
from a directory of TPTP formatted files (.tps file). The destination
directory is set accordig to the flag AUTO-LIB-DIR. It will not 
overwrite or delete any existing items: new items need to have 
different names

\item[MOVE-LIBOBJECT] \index{MOVE-LIBOBJECT} 
Move an object from one library file to another.
This command will also move a list of objects (either all of the same type, or
all of type NIL), into a single named file.

\item[REFORMAT] \index{REFORMAT} 
Reformat the specified file. Will attempt to load all the objects 
in a given file and then to rewrite that file in the standard library format.
This can be useful if you manually edit your library files a lot and they've 
started to look a little disorganized.
To reformat all files in your directories, use SPRING-CLEAN.

\item[REINDEX] \index{REINDEX} 
Reindex and reformat the specified file --- i.e. reconstruct the 
entries in the library master index relating to the objects in a 
particular file (you should only need this if you've been manually editing 
the libindex.rec file and have accidentally lost some entries...), and then
attempt to load and rewrite the file.
To reindex all files in your directories, use SPRING-CLEAN.
If you get an error because of parsing problems, try again but answer
no to "Reformat?" (it is not possible to format a file without 
parsing it).

\item[REMOVE-GOODMODES] \index{REMOVE-GOODMODES} 
Remove modes from a list of goodmodes.  Also, remove theorems that these goodmodes can prove.

\item[RENAME-OBJECT] \index{RENAME-OBJECT} 
Change the name of a library object. Does not move the object or 
alter it in any other way.

\item[SORT] \index{SORT} 
Sort the specified file into alphabetical order, except for the
given list of objects which are put at the head of the file (if they were 
originally in the file). This command reads in the entire file and then
rewrites it; it will incidentally also catch any parsing errors.

\item[SPRING-CLEAN] \index{SPRING-CLEAN} 
Will do its best to reindex, reformat and/or sort every file in the 
default library directory. If your files are a real mess, you might consider
using emacs to get rid of the worst of the problems before using SPRING-CLEAN.
It will also delete any file in the directory that doesn't belong there
Generally this means everything except .lib and libindex.rec files; you will be 
asked for confirmation before each file is deleted.
If you get an error because of parsing problems, try again but answer
no to "Reformat?" and "Sort?" (it is not possible to reformat or sort 
a file that cannot be parsed). Better yet, delete the unparseable entry and
try again.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Keywords}

\begin{description} 
\item[ADD-KEYWORD] \index{ADD-KEYWORD} 
Add a keyword to the keywords.rec file in your default directory.
This must be done before the keyword can be used anywhere else in the 
library.

\item[CHANGE-KEYWORDS] \index{CHANGE-KEYWORDS} 
Change the keywords attribute of a stored library object.
NOTE: not all keywords can be changed. TPS may modify your list of
keywords -- for example, if you specify FIRST-ORDER for a problem
that is higher-order, TPS will change it.

\item[SHOW-KEYWORDS] \index{SHOW-KEYWORDS} 
List all of the current acceptable keywords for the library.

\item[UPDATE-KEYWORDS] \index{UPDATE-KEYWORDS} 
For each library entry, update the keywords field
to include all of those keywords that can be determined automatically.
Any other keywords will be left untouched.
If you answer NO to the question about checking existing keywords, then 
this command will just attempt to fill in keywords for those objects 
which have none. If you answer YES, keywords will be generated for all 
of the objects (but existing user-defined  keywords will not be overwritten).

This command will almost certainly crash if it discovers any untypable 
definitions, missing needed-objects, circular definitions, misprints, etc...
in your library.
This probably won't damage your library, but you might want to make
a backup of all your files before you call this, just in case...
\item
\end{description}

\section{Best modes}

\begin{description} 
\item[ADD-BESTMODE] \index{ADD-BESTMODE} 
Add a mode for the specified theorem to the list in your
bestmodes.rec file. If the theorem and mode are already present in 
the list (either in your directory or in another user's), you will
be asked to confirm the creation of a new entry. If they are already 
present in your own directory, you will be given the option of 
overwriting them.

The TEST-INIT command sets the flag TEST-THEOREMS to a collection
of theorems associated with bestmodes.  TPS-TEST uses this list
to perform automatic testing.  ADD-BESTMODE gives you the option 
(using the argument AUTO-TEST) of having TEST-INIT include the 
new theorem/bestmode pair for automatic testing.  (The default 
is to include it.)  If the mode is intended to be used interactively 
(e.g., for a demo), then it should not be included for automatic testing.

See Also: TPS-TEST, TEST-INIT, TEST-THEOREMS

\item[DELETE-BESTMODE] \index{DELETE-BESTMODE} 
Remove an existing entry in your own bestmodes.rec file.
Attempting to remove an entry in another user's bestmode.rec
file will fail.

\item[FIND-DUP-MODES] \index{FIND-DUP-MODES} 
List all potential duplicates in the bestmodes.rec file.

\item[MODIFY-BESTMODE] \index{MODIFY-BESTMODE} 
Edit an existing entry in the bestmodes.rec file. 
Attempting to modify a read-only mode (i.e. one in another user's
directory) will create a modified copy in your own directory.

\item[SHOW-BESTMODE] \index{SHOW-BESTMODE} 
List all of the current best modes for theorems in the library.
Shows mode name, date, time for proof, and whether the mode is read/write
(in your library) or read-only (in someone else's library).

\item[SHOW-BESTMODE-THMS] \index{SHOW-BESTMODE-THMS} 
List all of the theorems that have bestmodes in bestmodes.rec files.

\item[SHOW-NEW-BESTMODES] \index{SHOW-NEW-BESTMODES} 
List all of the best modes which have been added since the 
given date. This will search all available bestmodes.rec files,
including those in other people's library directories.

\item[UPDATE-PROVABILITY] \index{UPDATE-PROVABILITY} 
Update the PROVABILITY attribute of all the gwffs for which a 
best mode is known.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Library Classification}

\begin{description} 
\item[CLASSIFY-CLASS] \index{CLASSIFY-CLASS} 
Classifies class1 under class2 within the current library classification scheme.

See Also: UNCLASSIFY-CLASS, CLASSIFY-ITEM, UNCLASSIFY-ITEM,
GOTO-CLASS, CLASS-SCHEME, CREATE-CLASS-SCHEME, PCLASS, PSCHEMES,
PCLASS-SCHEME-TREE, PCLASS-TREE, FETCH-LIBCLASS, FETCH-LIBCLASS*

\item[CLASSIFY-ITEM] \index{CLASSIFY-ITEM} 
Puts the library item into the given class within the
current library classification scheme.  If the item has needed objects,
TPS also offers to classify these.  If the flag CLASS-DIRECTION
is set to UP, the needed objects must be classified in ancestors
of the given class.  If the flag CLASS-DIRECTION is set to DOWN, 
the needed objects must be classified in descendants of the given class.  

See Also: CLASSIFY-CLASS, UNCLASSIFY-CLASS, UNCLASSIFY-ITEM,
GOTO-CLASS, CLASS-SCHEME, CREATE-CLASS-SCHEME, PCLASS, PSCHEMES,
PCLASS-SCHEME-TREE, PCLASS-TREE, FETCH-LIBCLASS, FETCH-LIBCLASS*

\item[CREATE-CLASS-SCHEME] \index{CREATE-CLASS-SCHEME} 
Create a classification scheme for the library.  A classification scheme
is a way of organizing library items into a tree (actually 
a directed acyclic graph) of classes.  Each class can have 
classes as children.  Each class has associated libitems.

This classification scheme can itself be saved in the library
and retrieved from the library as an object of type LIBCLASS.

A classification scheme can also be used to access the TPS
library using a Unix-style interface.  Use the command
UNIXLIB to enter the Unix-style top level for the library.

See Also: UNIXLIB, PSCHEMES, CLASS-SCHEME, GOTO-CLASS, CREATE-LIBCLASS, 
CLASSIFY-CLASS, CLASSIFY-ITEM, PCLASS-SCHEME, PCLASS-SCHEME-TREE,

CLASSIFY-ITEM, UNCLASSIFY-ITEM, GOTO-CLASS, PSCHEMES,
PCLASS, PCLASS-SCHEME-TREE, PCLASS-TREE, CREATE-CLASS-SCHEME

\item[FETCH-LIBCLASS*] \index{FETCH-LIBCLASS*} 
Fetches all the library items classified in the current class
within the current library classification scheme.  If the flag
CLASS-DIRECTION is set to Up, then FETCH-LIBCLASS* also fetches
all the libitems classified in ancestor classes.  If the flag
CLASS-DIRECTION is set to Down, then FETCH-LIBCLASS* also fetches
all the libitems classified in descendant classes.

\item[GENERATE-CLASS-SCHEME] \index{GENERATE-CLASS-SCHEME} 
Generate a classification scheme for all abbreviations,
constants, and gwffs.  TPS does some of the work, and prompts the
user to interactively make other choices.

This command can also be used to update an existing class-scheme
by including all library items which are not classified in
the existing class-scheme.

NOTE:  It is best to run this with a fresh core image.  Otherwise,
TPS may confuse items previously fetched from the library with
objects defined in the core TPS image.

\item[GOTO-CLASS] \index{GOTO-CLASS} 
Searches for classes of the given name within the
current library classification scheme.  If one
is found, that class is made the current class.
If several are found, the user is asked to choose.

See Also: CLASS-SCHEME, ROOT-CLASS, CREATE-CLASS-SCHEME, PCLASS, PSCHEMES,
PCLASS-SCHEME-TREE, PCLASS-TREE, CLASSIFY-CLASS, UNCLASSIFY-CLASS,

\item[PINTERSECT] \index{PINTERSECT} 
Print the objects that are classified in all the specified classes.

See Also: pintersect*

\item[PINTERSECT*] \index{PINTERSECT*} 
Finds and prints the name of all the objects which, for each
specified class, are classified in the class or a 'subclass'.

If CLASS-DIRECTION is set to DOWN, 'subclass' means a descendant class.

If CLASS-DIRECTION is set to UP, 'subclass' means a ancestor class.

See Also: pintersect

\item[PSCHEMES] \index{PSCHEMES} 
Prints a list of Library Classification Schemes in memory.

\item[CLASS-SCHEME] \index{CLASS-SCHEME} 
Classification Scheme for a library.
A classification scheme is a way of organizing library items into a tree 
(actually a directed acyclic graph) of classes.  Each class can have 
classes as children.  Each class has associated libitems.

To see what classification schemes are available call:

\begin{description} 
\item[FIND-GENERATED-CLASS] \index{FIND-GENERATED-CLASS} 
Find a class with an automatically generated name, i.e.,
one with prefix 'GEN.' and cd to its parent.  This command is
important when GENERATE-CLASS-SCHEME has been used to automatically
generate a class-scheme and one wants to rename and manipulate
these classes.

See Also:  GENERATE-CLASS-SCHEME, CD, MV, RENAME-CLASS, IMPORT-CLASS

\item[GENERATE-CLASS-SCHEME] \index{GENERATE-CLASS-SCHEME} 
Generate a classification scheme for all abbreviations,
constants, and gwffs.  TPS does some of the work, and prompts the
user to interactively make other choices.

NOTE:  It is best to run this with a fresh core image.  Otherwise,
TPS may confuse items previously fetched from the library with
objects defined in the core TPS image.

\section{Reading}

\begin{description} 
\item[DESTROY] \index{DESTROY} 
Remove a library object from TPS (the object will remain
stored in the library).

\item[FETCH] \index{FETCH} 
Make a library object from the current class available in TPS.
Will create a new TPS object if EXPERTFLAG is set to T, otherwise
will create a weak label for the new library object.

If more than one library object of this name is stored in
the library and SHOW-ALL-LIBOBJECTS is set to T,
the user is prompted to disambiguate.

\section{Library Classification}

\begin{description} 
\item[CD] \index{CD} 
Change to a different Library Class.

See Also: UNIXLIB

\item[CLASSIFY-ITEM] \index{CLASSIFY-ITEM} 
Classify a Library Item in the Current Library Class.

See Also: UNIXLIB

\item[COPY-CLASS-SCHEME] \index{COPY-CLASS-SCHEME} 
Copy an existing classification scheme to a new name so the new scheme can be modified and saved
in the library under this new name without changing the old classification scheme.

\item[CP] \index{CP} 
Copy a Library Item to another Class.
If the user specifies a Class to copy from,
then all the library items in that class are copied.

See Also: UNIXLIB, CLASSIFY-CLASS, LN

\item[LN] \index{LN} 
Classify a Class by essentially creating
a Link to another place it is classified.

Example:

ln /B/C /A

makes the class C a child of A.

Unlike the Unix ln command, the link must have the same name
as the target class.  Also, users are not allowed to create
a link that results in a cycle in the heirarchy.

See Also: UNIXLIB, CLASSIFY-CLASS, CP

\item[LS] \index{LS} 
List the Library Items and the Subclasses in the current class.

See Also: UNIXLIB

\item[MKDIR] \index{MKDIR} 
Creates a new Library Class classified under
the Current Library Class.

See Also: UNIXLIB, CREATE-LIBCLASS

\item[MV] \index{MV} 
Move an item or class to another class.

See Also:  UNIXLIB, CP, RM, CD, MKDIR

\item[RENAME-CLASS] \index{RENAME-CLASS} 
Renames a class.

NOTE:  This changes the name of the class everywhere in the structure.

See Also:  UNIXLIB, CP, RM, CD, MKDIR

\item[RM] \index{RM} 
Remove a Classification of a Class or Item.  This 
DOES NOT remove a library item from the library.  It only
removes the classification.

If a class has more than one parent and the class is removed
from its primary parent, a secondary parent becomes the primary
parent.  For example, if C has two parents A and B with A as the
primary parent.  Here, the full path to C is

/A/C

After performing

cd /A
rm C

the full path to C will be

/B/C

Leave REVIEW to the next enclosing top level.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Flags}

\begin{description} 
\item[CHANGED-FLAGS] \index{CHANGED-FLAGS} 
List all those flags whose current value is not
the default value.

\item[DESCRIBE] \index{DESCRIBE} 
Describe a flag.

\item[DESCRIBE*] \index{DESCRIBE*} 
List all flags under the subjects requested, along with their descriptions.

\item[KEY] \index{KEY} 
Look for a key phrase in the help strings (or just the names) 
of flags of given subjects. See also SEARCH, at the main top level.

\item[LIST] \index{LIST} 
List all flags in the given subjects with their current value.

\item[SAVE-FLAG-RELEVANCY-INFO] \index{SAVE-FLAG-RELEVANCY-INFO} 
Save Flag Relevancy Info built from Lisp Source Files

SEE ALSO:  UPDATE-RELEVANT, SHOW-RELEVANCE-PATHS

\item[SET] \index{SET} 
Directly set the value of a flag.

\item[SETFLAG] \index{SETFLAG} 
Set the value of a flag after examining it.

\item[SETFLAGS1] \index{SETFLAGS1} 
Simultaneously sets multiple flags of the form ((FLAG1 . VALUE1)
(FLAG2 . VALUE2)...) (the dots may be omitted); intended for use
when cutting and pasting records from library or bug files. The opening
and closing parentheses must be supplied.

\item[SETFLAGS2] \index{SETFLAGS2} 
Simultaneously sets multiple flags of the form "FLAG1: VALUE1
FLAG2: VALUE2 ...". Intended for use when cutting and pasting records 
from library or bug files. User must provide double quotes before and 
after pasting the record, and each flag and value pair should be 
separated by a newline. Flag-names containing double quotes must be 
set separately. This command cannot handle such cases.

\item[SHOW-RELEVANCE-PATHS] \index{SHOW-RELEVANCE-PATHS} 
Given a function F or flag A to start from and a flag B to end at,
show all paths which explain why the flag B should be relevant when F is called
or when the flag A has a certain value.

\item[SUBJECTS] \index{SUBJECTS} 
Print a list of currently defined subjects for REVIEW.

\item[UPDATE] \index{UPDATE} 
Update all the flags concerning the given subjects. ! will
leave the remaining flags unchanged.

\item[UPDATE-RELEVANT] \index{UPDATE-RELEVANT} 
Update a flag and flags that are known to be relevant to the value given.
For example,

update-relevant DEFAULT-MS

will allow the user to first set DEFAULT-MS.  If the user sets DEFAULT-MS to MS98-1,
then TPS will ask the user to set flags relevant to MS98-1.

When update-relevant is called, the user is given the option of using the current
flag relevancy information in memory, loading flag relevancy information saved to
a file using SAVE-FLAG-RELEVANCY, or rebuilding flag relevancy information from
the Lisp source files.
\item

           proof (e.g. around dots, and between line numbers and hypotheses).
VARY : print the turnstile one space after the hypotheses in each line
       (so it will move from line to line).

A list whose first element is one of NONE, EAGER, LAZY1 and DUAL,
and whose other (optional) elements are lists whose first element is
one of these four options and whose other elements are the names of 
definitions.
The first element is the default behaviour for rewriting definitions,
and the other lists are lists of exceptions to this default, with a
different behaviour specified.
NONE:  do not rewrite this definition at all.
EAGER: rewrite all of these definitions, in one big step, as soon 
       as possible.
LAZY1: rewrite these, one step at a time, when there are no more
       EAGER rewrites to do.
DUAL: as LAZY1, but rewrite these abbreviations A to a conjunction of
       A and A, and then deepen only one of these conjuncts. (e.g.
       TRANSITIVE p becomes 
       TRANSITIVE p AND FORALL x y z . [pxy AND pyz] IMPLIES pxz
LAZY2: synonym for DUAL.

For example: the value
(EAGER)
would be interpreted as "Rewrite every definition in one step."

(DUAL (EAGER TRANSITIVE) (NONE INJECTIVE SURJECTIVE))
would be interpreted as "Rewrite TRANSITIVE whenever it appears.
Don't ever rewrite INJECTIVE or SURJECTIVE. Rewrite every other

\item[SKOLEM-DEFAULT] \index{SKOLEM-DEFAULT@SKOLEM-DEFAULT, {\bf Flag}} 
Default method for skolemizing, in which wffs of the form
EXISTS y . M are replaced by M(g(...)). There are three possible ways to
do this:

SK3 is the method in which the arguments of g are the free variables
 of EXISTS y . M.

If DEEPEST, the default next obligation is found by depth-first
search of the obtree, if HIGHEST it is found by breadth-first-search, 
if D-SMALLEST then the deepest of the set of smallest obligations (i.e.

Options are:
LOWEST : Chooses the obligation which lies lowest (i.e. furthest from the
root)
HIGHEST : Chooses the obligation nearest to the root (but not the root).

\section{Mtree Auto}

\begin{description} 
\item[MT-SUBSUMPTION-CHECK] \index{MT-SUBSUMPTION-CHECK@MT-SUBSUMPTION-CHECK, {\bf Flag}} 
If SAME-CONNS or T, will check whether the node about to be added is
duplicated elsewhere in the tree, and will reject it if it is. (This will use
the SAME-TAG function described below, and then do a more thorough check if the 
tags match.)

If SUBSET-CONNS, will check whether the connections at the node about to be
added are a subset of those at some other node. (This is only really useful in
MT94-11, where all possible new nodes are added, breadth-first, to the tree.
It is probably too restrictive for the other mtree searches.)

If SAME-TAG will check whether the tag (an integer generated from the list of 
connections) is the same as any other existing tag, and will reject it if it is.
See TAG-CONN-FN and TAG-LIST-FN. (Note that most tag functions can produce the
same tag for different matings, so this may reject connections unnecessarily.)

If NIL, will turn off subsumption checking altogether.
It takes values of type MT-SUBSUMPTION and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{MTREE-TOP}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
SAME-CONNS

literals, MT94-12 will behave in the same way as MT94-11
If it contains MT94-12-TRIGGER or more, MT94-12 will choose a literal
with as few mates as possible. There are two extrema: infinity 
means that the least branch will only be chosen if the obligation
is as big as the initial obligation; 0 means that the least branch 
will always be chosen.

Determines how the tag (a number attached to each mating) is calculated.
Should be the name of a function which, given a connection, will generate an
integer from it. See MT-SUBSUMPTION-CHECK and TAG-MATING-FN.

Current settings are 
TAG-CONN-QUICK, which uses TPS's internal number for the connection. (Actually,
it uses (1 + this number), so as to avoid multiplying by one.)
TAG-CONN-LEAFNO, which multiplies the integer parts of the two leaf names
in the given connection.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects \texttt{MTREE-TOP}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}

\item[TAG-MATING-FN] \index{TAG-MATING-FN@TAG-MATING-FN, {\bf Flag}} 
Determines how the tags for each connection are combined to produce
a tag for the entire mating.

. when set variables are solved instantiated using constraints
  (DELAY-SETVARS must be set to T)

If lemmas L1, . . ., Ln are used to prove A, then the full proof
consists of proofs of each of the Li and a proof of A using the
lemmas Li.  In other words, it is a proof of

[L1 and . . . and Ln] and [[L1 and . . . and Ln] implies A]

\item[QUERY-USER] \index{QUERY-USER@QUERY-USER, {\bf Flag}} 
Has the following effects according to its value:
T :  User will be queried by the mating search process as to whether 
  a duplication of variables should occur, unification
  depth should be increased, etc.
NIL :  The mating search process will take some action that makes sense.
QUERY-JFORMS : The mating search process will stop after printing each 
vpform and ask whether to search on this vpform or to generate another.
(Note: in MS90-3, this is pointless, since the vpform never changes.)
SHOW-JFORMS : Like QUERY-JFORMS, but automatically answers no to each 
question (and hence never actually proceeds with a search).
QUERY-SLISTS : In the TEST top level, stops after each setting of the
flags and asks whether to search with those settings.

If this is set to T, then diy finds all positive and
negative literals which have a proper subterm of propositional,
set, or relation types.  For example, the jform may have a positive
literal P X(OA) and a negative literal P Y(OA).  For each pair
of subterms such as X and Y, extensionality lemmas of the form

    forall x [X x EQUIV Y x] implies X = Y

\section{MS91-6 and MS91-7 search procedures}

\begin{description} 
\item[MS91-INTERLEAVE] \index{MS91-INTERLEAVE@MS91-INTERLEAVE, {\bf Flag}} 
In MS91-*, primitive substitutions are generated by NAME-PRIM,
and they are applied to the master eproof before the search mechanism 
chooses particular parts of that eproof (and hence particular 
substitutions) to try and prove.

If MS91-INTERLEAVE is NIL, all of the substitutions generated by NAME-PRIM
are applied at once, and then the search mechanism chooses among them, probably
in the order in which they were generated. The process of applying them to
the eproof can take a very long time.

If MS91-INTERLEAVE is an integer n, we take n primsubs at a time for each 
variable which has primsubs, and apply only those to the eproof. Once we
have searched through those (to be specific, once we decide to generate new
options), we take the next n primsubs for each variable and apply them, 
and so on. This is much quicker, and has the advantage of not having to 
work through every primsub for the first variable before starting work on 
the next variable.

If MS91-INTERLEAVE is non-NIL, and NEW-OPTION-SET-LIMIT is greater than
MS91-INTERLEAVE * (\#  of vars that have primsubs), then TPS will reduce 
NEW-OPTION-SET-LIMIT. This ensures that single substitutions are 
generated before multiple substitutions.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{PRIMSUBS}, \texttt{MS91-7}, \texttt{MS91-6}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}

seconds, and if the next has twice as many paths it will get twice
as many seconds, and so on...).
When NIL, every option set will get the same search time.

New option-sets, when constructed, will be accepted if their weights lie
in the range [current weight limit, current weight limit + MS91-WEIGHT-LIMIT-RANGE].
Hence increasing this value means that more option-sets will be acceptable during 
the creation stage. If this range is very small, there is a risk that no option
sets at all will be accepted and the search will waste time recreating these sets
with a higher current weight limit. If it is too large, then there is a risk that
high-weighted sets will be considered before lower-weighted ones.
Note: option sets of weight INFINITY will never be accepted, no matter what.

This is the function for deciding when to add new options

  OPTIONS-GENERATE-ARG percent of the possible option sets have been 
  used, and each option appears in at least one option set.
* ADD-OPTIONS-COUNT generates new options when more than 
  OPTIONS-GENERATE-ARG different option sets have been tried.

  acceptable weight bracket for a new option set exceeds 
  OPTIONS-GENERATE-ARG.

\item[RECONSIDER-FN] \index{RECONSIDER-FN@RECONSIDER-FN, {\bf Flag}} 
A function that should take a weight as argument and
return a value to be used as a new weight after the associated option set
runs out of time. Currently, the predefined functions are INF-WEIGHT 
SQUARE-WEIGHT, DOUBLE-WEIGHT and INCREMENT-WEIGHT (which, respectively,
make reconsidering an old option set impossible, very unlikely,
quite likely and probable). INCREMENT-WEIGHT actually adds 10 to the weight 
of an option set, as adding 1 is insignificant under most circumstances.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{MS91-7}, \texttt{MS91-6}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
DOUBLE-WEIGHT

\item[WEIGHT-A-FN] \index{WEIGHT-A-FN@WEIGHT-A-FN, {\bf Flag}} 
A function that should take an option as argument and

such predefined function is EXPANSION-LEVEL-WEIGHT-A, which returns
the expansion level of the option to be used as a weight.
The total weight of a set of options is the weight-a of each option
plus the weight-b of the set plus the weight-c of the set.

  multiple subs and duplications used in the option set (see the flags 
  PENALTY-FOR-EACH-PRIMSUB, PENALTY-FOR-MULTIPLE-PRIMSUBS and  
  PENALTY-FOR-MULTIPLE-SUBS for more information),
* ALL-PENALTIES-FN which is much the same as SIMPLE-WEIGHT-B-FN but also adds
  a penalty for extra duplications given by the PENALTY-FOR-ORDINARY-DUP 
  flag, and 
* SIMPLEST-WEIGHT-B-FN, which returns 1 for the original option set and adds 
  1 for each primsub or duplication (the idea is to set the coefficients of 
  weight-a and weight-c to zero while using SIMPLEST-WEIGHT-B-FN).
The total weight of a set of options is the weight-a of each option
plus the weight-b of the set plus the weight-c of the set.

\end{lstlisting}

\item[MEASUREMENTS] \index{MEASUREMENTS@MEASUREMENTS, {\bf Flag}} 
A flag set by the system to give information about

When T, MS98-DUP duplicates variables which have primsubs;
when NIL, it doesn't. (Note that duplicating the variable will
not duplicate the primsub; it will produce another copy of the 
unsubstituted-for tree below that expansion node.)

\item[MS98-FIRST-FRAGMENT] \index{MS98-FIRST-FRAGMENT@MS98-FIRST-FRAGMENT, {\bf Flag}} 
If non-NIL, this will move a single fragment to the
beginning of the literal ordering, as follows:
T : set of support strategy, more or less. The starting 
    fragment will be the last non-duplicate fragment 
    enumerated. This will be the rightmost part of the wff
    to be proven.
n : (for integer n) the starting fragment will be whichever
    fragment contains LEAFn. If this leaf is part of a duplicate
    fragment, or does not exist at all, then this will behave
    like T.

NB: This flag overrides MS98-BASE-PRIM; the chosen fragment may
always be part of a primitve substitution.

      and vice versa.
If 8, use the ratio of blocked to touched components.

\item[MS98-REWRITE-UNIF] \index{MS98-REWRITE-UNIF@MS98-REWRITE-UNIF, {\bf Flag}}

\item[MS98-TRACE] \index{MS98-TRACE@MS98-TRACE, {\bf Flag}} 
Given a mating in advance, this is used to trace the progress 
of MS98-1 search for a mating.  This is a list of symbols which
indicate what to trace.  The possible symbols are:

1. MATING - Search as usual, keeping a record of when good connections and
components are formed.  The value of *ms98-trace-file* is a string giving the
name of a file into which this information is stored.
2. MATING-FILTER - The search is filtered to only consider good
connections and components.  This is useful for a quick check
if the search can possibly succeed.  Typically, when MATING-FILTER
is on the list, then so is MATING.

If the list is nonempty at all, then the trace is considered 'on'.
The consequence of this is that duplications and primsubs are
skipped at the beginning of search, and that the output of the
trace will be sent to the file indicated by the global variable
*ms98-trace-file*.

Given two disjuncts X OR Y and A OR B, this flag 
determines when we are allowed to make a component containing 
connections X-A and Y-B (assuming they're unifiable connections).
The higher the number, the more stringent (and more time-consuming)
the test; any correct mating is guaranteed to pass any of these tests:
1: MAX-MATES is not 1.
2: As for 1, plus we require an extra mate for each of X,Y,A and B.
3: As for 2, plus we require that all of these new mates be 
   pairwise compatible with each other.
4: As for 3, plus we require that all of these new mates be 
   simultaneously compatible with each other.

3 and 4 are only applicable to higher-order searches.

There is an extra value, 0, which rejects any such connections
even if max-mates is not 1. This results in an incomplete search,
but is often acceptable.
It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
1
\end{lstlisting}

\item[MS98-VARIABLE-ORDER] \index{MS98-VARIABLE-ORDER@MS98-VARIABLE-ORDER, {\bf Flag}} 
Determines the variable ordering for the unification
graph. Only affects higher-order searches.
Suppose N is the maximum number of unifiers for a 
given list of variables, and K is the length of the list.
For values 0--3, the variables are first grouped into lists of duplicate
copies (so each variable is listed with its duplicates, if any)
0 : Sort by N, largest first.
1 : Sort by N, smallest first.
2 : Sort by K, largest first.
3 : Sort by K, smallest first.
10--13 : Group the variables into lists of length 1, and then proceed
as 0--3.
20--23 : Group the variables into lists that occur together (i.e. two
variables go into the same list if their expansion nodes are not separated 
by any junctive node in the etree) and then proceed as for 0--3.
30--33 : Group the variables as for 0--3, and then reduce the lists 
to length 1 while keeping the variables in the same order.
40--43 : Group the variables as for 20--23, and then reduce the lists 
to length 1 while keeping the variables in the same order.
Other values X will behave like (X div 10) for variable grouping and
(X mod 10) for ordering the groups.
It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{MS98-MINOR}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}

\section{Extensional Search}

\item[EXT-SEARCH-LIMIT] \index{EXT-SEARCH-LIMIT@EXT-SEARCH-LIMIT, {\bf Flag}} 
If EXT-SEARCH-LIMIT is an integer which will place a limit on the extensional search
procedure MS03-7.  Given such a limit, search is incomplete and guaranteed to eventually terminate.
If EXT-SEARCH-LIMIT is set to infinity, then the search may not terminate.
It takes values of type INTEGER+-OR-INFINITY and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{MS03-7}, \texttt{EXT-SEARCH}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
INFINITY
\end{lstlisting}

\item[MS03-DUP-METHOD] \index{MS03-DUP-METHOD@MS03-DUP-METHOD, {\bf Flag}} 
The method by which different duplication options are considered
by the MS03-7 search procedure.

1.  Simply add the oldest expansion arc that has not been considered yet
(and any arcs related to it) each time a new option is tried.
This will lead to extremely large jforms in most cases.

2.  Works like 1 except with respect to expansion arcs that either
contain a nontrivial set substitution (ie, one with logical connectives)
or are associated with a set existence lemma.  With respect to these
'set expansion arcs', we remove whatever such arcs are in the current
option and replace them with a new set expansion arc (thus considering
a new set expansion option).  If every single set expansion option
has been considered, we begin considering two at a time, and so on.

3.  Works like 2 except we treat every expansion of set type
as a set expansion arc instead of just the ones with nontrivial
set substitutions.

we might consider connecting two literals that are already connected.
Sometimes this speeds up the search, presumably by keeping
us from looking at possible connections beneath connections (needed to show
equivalences).

\item[MS03-USE-JFORMS] \index{MS03-USE-JFORMS@MS03-USE-JFORMS, {\bf Flag}} 
If T, MS03-7 uses (dissolved) jforms during search.

principle can restrict the branching of search.  If NIL, jforms
are not used, which may result in the consideration of connections
which only span paths already spanned by other connections.

When attempting to E-unify two literals a and b, this weight is
multiplied by disjdepth(a) * disjdepth(b) where disjdepth of a literal
is the number of disjunctions above the literal on the jform.
The effect of this is to prefer mating nodes that are closer to being 'global'.

If MS03-USE-JFORMS is set to NIL, the disjdepth of a node is
measured by the number of disjunctive nodes above the node in the edag.
This measure is less precise, since dissolution isn't used.

HX  -- Hongwei Xi's version which is intended to work on
       any natural deduction proof, normal or not.  This

\item[NATREE-DEBUG] \index{NATREE-DEBUG@NATREE-DEBUG, {\bf Flag}} 
To invoke the debugging facilities mentioned in the Programmers
Guide associated with NAT-ETREE. If NATREE-VERSION is set to CEB and
NATREE-DEBUG is set to T, then the code doublechecks that a mating exists,

\section{Unification}

\begin{description} 
\item[APPLY-MATCH] \index{APPLY-MATCH@APPLY-MATCH, {\bf Flag}} 
Heuristic to decide the pair that should be given to match.
UN88 procedures:
APPLY-MATCH-ALL-FRDPAIRS applies match to all flexible-rigid pairs 
   and chooses whichever will have fewest substitutions.
APPLY-MATCH-ALL-FRDPAIRS-MSV does the same, but also checks for
   MAX-SUBSTS-VAR violations at the same time.
APPLY-MATCH-MAX-SUBSTS applies match to whichever flexible-rigid
   pair is closest to exceeding the bound in MAX-SUBSTS-VAR.
   If it finds one with a unique substitution, it uses that.
APPLY-MATCH-MIN-SUBSTS is like the above, but chooses the pair
   which is farthest from the MAX-SUBSTS-VAR bound.
APPLY-MATCH-MOST-CONSTS applies match to whichever flex-rigid
   pair contains the most constant symbols.
(The last two of these are all but useless; both of the SUBSTS
versions will be disastrous if MAX-SUBSTS-VAR is NIL...)

UN90 procedures:
This flag is almost always ignored (the default behaviour is
much like APPLY-MATCH-ALL-FRDPAIRS, but see NUM-FRPAIRS and
COUNTSUBS-FIRST for more details). The exception is if it is
APPLY-MATCH-MAX-SUBSTS, in which case it will go for whichever
pair is closest to exceeding the MAX-SUBSTS-VAR bound (but will
still use NUM-FRPAIRS and COUNTSUBS-FIRST).
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
APPLY-MATCH-ALL-FRDPAIRS
\end{lstlisting}

\item[COUNTSUBS-FIRST] \index{COUNTSUBS-FIRST@COUNTSUBS-FIRST, {\bf Flag}} 
if NIL, the substitutions which MATCH generates for each dpair in the
unification process are generated and counted, and then MATCH is
actually applied to the variable for which this number is smallest; if
T, the substitutions are counted before they are generated, and only
those which will be applied are actually generated.
Applies to UN90 only.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
NIL
\end{lstlisting}

\item[DNEG-IMITATION] \index{DNEG-IMITATION@DNEG-IMITATION, {\bf Flag}} 
Determine when to produce imitation terms that contain
double negations. Only applies in UN88 when REDUCE-DOUBLE-NEG is T
(in UN88 otherwise, it is implicitly set to ALWAYS; in UN90 it is
implicitly set to CONST-FLEX).
When TPS mates two flexible literals f and g, it adds (f . ~g) as
a dpair. Because it may really have needed (g . ~f), we allow 
imitation terms to contain double negations even if REDUCE-DOUBLE-NEG
is T. The options are as follows:
ALWAYS always allows double negations to be used.
CONST forbids them for dpairs of the form (f . ~G), where G is a
  constant, but allows them otherwise.
FLEX forbids them for (f . ~g) if g was created by a double negation
  in the first place (this prevents endless cycles), but allows them
  otherwise.
CONST-FLEX forbids them in the two cases for CONST and FLEX, but allows
  them otherwise.
NEVER forbids them outright.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
CONST-FLEX
\end{lstlisting}

\item[ETA-RULE] \index{ETA-RULE@ETA-RULE, {\bf Flag}} 
If T, eta rule is permitted in the unification package.
This can be T or NIL for the UN88 procedure, but it can only be
T for the UN90 procedure. (In fact, UN90 ignores this flag.)
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
T
\end{lstlisting}

\item[IMITATION-FIRST] \index{IMITATION-FIRST@IMITATION-FIRST, {\bf Flag}} 
Controls whether imitations are considered before projections during
unification procedure UN88. No effect in UN90.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}

\item[LEIBNIZ-SUB-CHECK] \index{LEIBNIZ-SUB-CHECK@LEIBNIZ-SUB-CHECK, {\bf Flag}} 
When T, check substitutions which are made for Leibniz
variables, to ensure that they are relevant in their first argument.
When NIL, don't do this.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}

\item[MAX-DUP-PATHS] \index{MAX-DUP-PATHS@MAX-DUP-PATHS, {\bf Flag}} 
Any universal jform which has more than MAX-DUP-PATHS paths below it cannot get

It takes values of type INTEGER+-OR-INFINITY and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{MS93-1}, \texttt{MS92-9}, \texttt{MS88}, \texttt{MS89}, \texttt{MS91-6}, \texttt{MS91-7}, \texttt{MS90-9}, \texttt{MS90-3}, \texttt{MATING-SEARCH}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
INFINITY
\end{lstlisting}

\item[MAX-SEARCH-DEPTH] \index{MAX-SEARCH-DEPTH@MAX-SEARCH-DEPTH, {\bf Flag}} 
If non nil, search to depth MAX-SEARCH-DEPTH, else search to
arbitrary depth. Takes precedence over all other flags that may 
control the search depth in a unification tree (i.e. no tree is ever
generated to a greater depth, although other flags may cause the 
unification search to stop temporarily at a shallower depth. Used 
in all search procedures, and in UN88 and UN90. 
See flag MAX-UTREE-DEPTH also.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{IMPORTANT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
NIL
\end{lstlisting}

\item[MAX-UTREE-DEPTH] \index{MAX-UTREE-DEPTH@MAX-UTREE-DEPTH, {\bf Flag}} 
If non-NIL, maximum depth to which unification tree is to be 
generated. Used only in UN88 procedures. This variable is incremented 
during mating-search to allow unification tree to grow to 
greater depth as the search progresses. The unification tree
is, however, never searched or generated to a depth greater than
MAX-SEARCH-DEPTH provided it is non NIL and a positive integer. One can
also consider this variable to be the initial value to which unification
trees are generated during mating-search.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{IMPORTANT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
5
\end{lstlisting}

\item[MIN-QUICK-DEPTH] \index{MIN-QUICK-DEPTH@MIN-QUICK-DEPTH, {\bf Flag}} 
The minimum depth to which a unification tree should be generated
when unification tree is searched only to non branching depth. Setting this
flag to 1 has the effect of generating the tree to non branching depth.
Applicable only to UN88.
MIN-QUICK-DEPTH is used only in the process of checking whether two
literals are potential mates. It is used to construct the connection graph.
See flag MAX-SEARCH-DEPTH also.
See MAX-SUBSTS-QUICK for a different way to achieve a similar effect.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
3
\end{lstlisting}

\item[MS-DIR] \index{MS-DIR@MS-DIR, {\bf Flag}} 
The director to be used in mating search.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{MS91-6}, \texttt{MS89}, \texttt{MS88}, \texttt{MATING-SEARCH}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
QUASI-TPS1
\end{lstlisting}

\item[MS90-3-QUICK] \index{MS90-3-QUICK@MS90-3-QUICK, {\bf Flag}} 
If T, do MS88 quick unification on dpairs in MS90-3.
If NIL, don't.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}, \texttt{MS92-9}, \texttt{MS93-1}, \texttt{MS91-7}, \texttt{MS90-9}, \texttt{MS90-3}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
NIL
\end{lstlisting}

\item[PRUNING] \index{PRUNING@PRUNING, {\bf Flag}} 
If T, the unification routine will prune the tree as it goes.
Only works for BREADTH-FIRST and BEST-FIRST unification, and
only then in MS88.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
NIL
\end{lstlisting}

\item[REDUCE-DOUBLE-NEG] \index{REDUCE-DOUBLE-NEG@REDUCE-DOUBLE-NEG, {\bf Flag}} 
If T double negations are eliminated during lambda contraction
at a unification node. This only applies in UN88.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
T
\end{lstlisting}

\item[RIGID-PATH-CK] \index{RIGID-PATH-CK@RIGID-PATH-CK, {\bf Flag}} 
If T, apply rigid-path checking when doing unification. If NIL, 
switch to original unification. Both UN90 and UN88 unification 
procedures are affected by the flag.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{MS93-1}, \texttt{MS92-9}, \texttt{MS91-7}, \texttt{MS91-6}, \texttt{MS90-9}, \texttt{MS90-3}, \texttt{MS89}, \texttt{MS88}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
T
\end{lstlisting}

\item[STOP-AT-TSN] \index{STOP-AT-TSN@STOP-AT-TSN, {\bf Flag}}

node. Otherwise, it continues generating the tree.
This only applies to UN88.

T
\end{lstlisting}

\item[SUBSUMPTION-CHECK] \index{SUBSUMPTION-CHECK@SUBSUMPTION-CHECK, {\bf Flag}} 
Limited subsumption check should be done during unification when
this flag is set. Applies for procedures UN88 and UN90, although it is
much more useful in UN88 (UN90 does not generate as many subsumed nodes,
and so subsumption-checking tends to be a waste of time). 
See also SUBSUMPTION-NODES and SUBSUMPTION-DEPTH.
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
NIL
\end{lstlisting}

\item[SUBSUMPTION-DEPTH] \index{SUBSUMPTION-DEPTH@SUBSUMPTION-DEPTH, {\bf Flag}} 
Subsumption checking takes a lot of time, compared 
to unification, which means that checking a new node may
take more time than it could possibly save, particularly
if the node is almost at the maximum depth for the 
unification tree.
In the unification tree, new nodes at depth SUBSUMPTION-DEPTH
or deeper will not be subsumption-checked; other new nodes
will be. Having SUBSUMPTION-DEPTH INFINITY means that all new 
nodes are subsumption-checked; SUBSUMPTION-DEPTH 0 is just
a slower way of turning subsumption-checking off altogether.
(You should use SUBSUMPTION-CHECK NIL to do that!)
This flag only applies when SUBSUMPTION-CHECK is T.
See also SUBSUMPTION-NODES.
It takes values of type INTEGER+-OR-INFINITY and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
INFINITY
\end{lstlisting}

\item[SUBSUMPTION-NODES] \index{SUBSUMPTION-NODES@SUBSUMPTION-NODES, {\bf Flag}} 
When SUBSUMPTION-CHECK is T, this flag determines
which other nodes should be examined to see if they subsume the
new node being considered. The values are as follows, arranged
in order with the quickest first:
PATH-NODES checks only those nodes on the path from the root to
  the new node.
LEAF-NODES checks only the leaf nodes in the tree.
LP-NODES checks leaf nodes and those on the path to the
  new node.
ALL-NODES checks every node in the tree.
Some nodes will always be excluded from subsumption checking,
regardless of the value of this flag. In particular, two nodes
representing different sets of connections will not be 
compared. 
This flag only applies to the UN88 procedure; in UN90, if
subsumption-checking is used at all, it is implicitly
set to ALL-NODES.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
LP-NODES
\end{lstlisting}

\item[TOTAL-NUM-OF-DUPS] \index{TOTAL-NUM-OF-DUPS@TOTAL-NUM-OF-DUPS, {\bf Flag}} 
Max number of duplications allowed at any time 
during a search using path-focused duplication. Compare
NUM-OF-DUPS. This flag will be ignored if set to NIL.
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS IS BUGGY; setting it to NIL is safest.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-POSINTEGER and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{MS90-3}, \texttt{MATING-SEARCH}, \texttt{IMPORTANT}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
NIL
\end{lstlisting}

\item[UNI-SEARCH-HEURISTIC] \index{UNI-SEARCH-HEURISTIC@UNI-SEARCH-HEURISTIC, {\bf Flag}} 
Search strategy used to select the next node in the unification tree.
BREADTH-FIRST and DEPTH-FIRST are exactly as they sound;
BEST-FIRST takes whichever leaf node has the fewest free
variables (and is not already terminal).
All of these options work for UN90 (ms90-*, ms91-7, ms92-*);
BREADTH-FIRST and BEST-FIRST are the only options for UN88 (ms88, ms89, 
ms91-6, mtree).
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
BREADTH-FIRST
\end{lstlisting}

\item[UNIF-COUNTER] \index{UNIF-COUNTER@UNIF-COUNTER, {\bf Flag}} 
If this flag is non-zero, PP* will be called to 
print out information about the current unification tree at 
regular intervals. This flag determines the length of
the intervals, measured by the number of calls to the
unification procedure. The amount of information is
determined by the setting of UNIF-COUNTER-OUTPUT.
If the flag is set to 0, this feature will be turned off.
This flag only applies in UN88 unification.
It takes values of type INTEGER+ and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
0

\item[UNIF-TRIGGER] \index{UNIF-TRIGGER@UNIF-TRIGGER, {\bf Flag}} 
If this flag is non-NIL, PP* will be called to 
print out information about the current unification tree 
after certain events (compare UNIF-COUNTER).
Settings are:
NIL: Print nothing.
UTREE-END: Printout whenever a tree has come to an end
  (either failure or success; NB UNIF-COUNTER-OUTPUT 6 or 7
   will not work with this setting.)
UTREE-END1: As UTREE-END, but also gives output when quick
  unification ends a tree without completing it.
UTREE-BEGIN: Printout the root node when unification is
  first called.
PROPS-CHANGE: Printout whenever the properties of a node 
  are different from those of its parent. (Best used with
  UNIF-COUNTER-OUTPUT 6 or 7.) 
The amount of information is determined by the setting of 
UNIF-COUNTER-OUTPUT. If the flag is set to NIL, this 
feature will be turned off.

EXHAUSTIVE-SEARCH, which tries all combinations of flags in a searchlist, 
 varying one flag through its entire range before trying the next flag.
BREADTH-FIRST-SEARCH, which also tries all combinations of flags, but 
 varies each flag a little at a time.
PRESS-DOWN, which is used by the PRESS-DOWN command.
PRESS-DOWN-2, which behaves like breadth-first search except that if varying
 a flag makes the search faster, that flag is then prevented
 from returning above its original value (the range of each flag is 
 assumed to be ordered; if the range is (A B C D), and setting it to
 C results in a faster search, it will never again be set to A or B).

\item[MAX-DOMAIN-SIZE] \index{MAX-DOMAIN-SIZE@MAX-DOMAIN-SIZE, {\bf Flag}} 
The maximum size of semantic domains TPS will consider. It does not
make sense to set this to any value other than a size such a domain
may have.  For example, the default value 2\textasciicircum 16 is 65536.  Assuming
every base type is of size 2, the next reasonable value would be 2\textasciicircum 32,
which is over 4 billion.  Consequently, the value of this flag should
not be changed until TPS is either considering models other than
standard models based on powers of 2 or computing power increases
tremendously.

 then to y\textasciicircum 2, and so on. If there is another variable y, of a different 
 type, it makes no difference.

 two variables of the same name at different types (so it tends to 
 produce higher exponents than REN-VAR-X1).

\section{Basic Abbreviations}

\begin{description} 
\item[REWRITE-EQUALITIES] \index{REWRITE-EQUALITIES@REWRITE-EQUALITIES, {\bf Flag}} 
One of the following:
NONE: do not rewrite equalities
ONLY-EXT: rewrite only those equalities that can be rewritten using
          extensionality.
LEIBNIZ: rewrite all equalities using the Leibniz definition.
ALL: rewrite all equalities, to an equivalence for those of type OOO,
     to the extensional form 
      [lambda f(AB) lambda g(AB) forall x(B) f x = g x]
     for those of type O(AB)(AB), and to the Leibniz form
      [lambda x(A) lambda y(A) forall q(OA). q x implies q y]
     for those of type OAA.
LAZY2: As for ALL, but keeping a duplicate leaf as in the LAZY2
       setting of the flag REWRITE-DEFNS.
PARITY1: Uses the parity to determine whether equalities should be
    rewritten as the setting LEIBNIZ or as the setting ALL.  For example,
    using PARITY1 when trying to prove the wff 
              A(OI) = B(OI) implies C
    the equality is expaned using Leibniz, and when trying to prove the wff
              D implies A(OI) = B(OI)
    the equality is expanded using extensionality.  The heuristic
    is that we often use the substitutivity property when we use an equation
    and use extensionality to show an equation.

REPLACE -- the value of PRIM-BDTYPES will be changed to an 
automatically-generated list of all the primitive types used in 
the gwff to be proven.
REPLACE-SUB -- as for replace, except that the list will be of all
the subtypes of the types that appear in the gwff.
APPEND -- the same list is calculated as for REPLACE, but instead
of replacing the current setting of PRIM-BDTYPES it will be appended
to it.
APPEND-SUB -- the same list is calculated as for APPEND, but instead
of replacing the current setting of PRIM-BDTYPES it will be appended
to it.
IGNORE -- no list will be generated, and the user's setting of 
PRIM-BDTYPES will be left intact.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{IMPORTANT}, \texttt{PRIMSUBS}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
REPLACE
\end{lstlisting}

\item[PRIM-PREFIX] \index{PRIM-PREFIX@PRIM-PREFIX, {\bf Flag}} 
Prefix for weak labels associated with primitive substitutions.
It takes values of type SYMBOL and belongs to subjects \texttt{PRIMSUBS}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}

\item[PRIMSUB-METHOD] \index{PRIMSUB-METHOD@PRIMSUB-METHOD, {\bf Flag}} 
Takes one of the values PR89, PR93, PR95, PR97, PR97A, PR97B.
This determines how primsubs will be generated, in 
conjunction with MAX-PRIM-DEPTH, MIN-PRIM-DEPTH, 
MAX-PRIM-LITS and MIN-PRIM-LITS.
With PRIMSUB-METHOD PR89 : 
 Primsubs of the form "exists x . literal" and 
 "forall x . literal" will be generated.
With PRIMSUB-METHOD PR93 :
 For all integers from MIN-PRIM-DEPTH to MAX-PRIM-DEPTH:
  At depth 1, a single quantifier is introduced, as in PR89. 
  At depth N>1, we have (N-1) quantifiers ranging over a formula
  containing (N-1) conjunctions {disjunctions} of (N-2) 
  disjunctions {conjunctions}.
With PRIMSUB-METHOD PR95 :
 For all integers from MIN-PRIM-DEPTH to MAX-PRIM-DEPTH:
  At depth 1, as in PR89.
  At depth N>1, we have (N-1) quantifiers ranging over a formula
  with between MIN-PRIM-LITS and MAX-PRIM-LITS literals, with
  all combinations of connectives between them.
With PRIMSUB-METHOD PR97 :
 For all integers from MIN-PRIM-DEPTH to MAX-PRIM-DEPTH:
  At depth N>0, we have (N-1) quantifiers ranging over each 
  subformula taken from the etree which contains between 
  MIN-PRIM-LITS and MAX-PRIM-LITS literals. You can see these
 subformulas by doing NAME-PRIM from the MATE top level. (Note:
 both the instantiated and uninstantiated versions of each 
 definition are used.)
With PRIMSUB-METHOD PR97A :
 As in PR97, but all substitutions are in negation normal form.
With PRIMSUB-METHOD PR97B :
 The substitutions from PR97A and PR95 are interleaved. The order
 is determined firstly by the number of literals, then by the number of
 quantifiers, and lastly with PR97 substs taking precedence over PR95.
With PRIMSUB-METHOD PR97C :
 Using the connectives AND and OR, and the quantifiers EXISTS and
 FORALL (ranging over variables of types PRIM-BDTYPES), and also using
 any abbreviations or equalities that occur in the gwff to be proven, 
 primsubs are built up using the bounds given by MIN- and MAX-PRIM-LITS
 and MIN- and MAX-PRIM-DEPTH. See also PR97C-PRENEX and PR97C-MAX-ABBREVS.
With PRIMSUB-METHOD PR00  :
 This uses higher order unification to determine set substitutions
 that solve part of the mating search in advance.  PR00 only works with 
 DEFAULT-MS MS98-1 and SKOLEM-DEFAULT NIL. PR00 can be controlled using the flags
 PR00-MAX-SUBSTS-VAR, PR00-REQUIRE-ARG-DEPS, PR00-NUM-ITERATIONS.

\item[REWRITE-EQUIVS] \index{REWRITE-EQUIVS@REWRITE-EQUIVS, {\bf Flag}} 
This chooses one of the two ways of constructing an etree
from an equivalence A EQUIV B:
1 chooses the option with the fewest vertical paths
   (positive: A AND B OR ~A AND ~B
    negative: A IMPLIES B AND B IMPLIES A)
2 chooses the option with the fewest horizontal paths
   (negative: A AND B OR ~A AND ~B
    positive: A IMPLIES B AND B IMPLIES A)
3 behaves as for 2 except for the first equivalence it finds, 
  when it behaves as for 1. (This means that a gwff which is a 
  quantified equivalence will produce an etree which can be split.)
4 always chooses A IMPLIES B AND B IMPLIES A
5 always chooses A AND B OR ~A AND ~B
Any other setting will behave like 1.

This does not work with MIN-QUANTIFIER-SCOPE T; in that case, 
etrees will be constructed as in case 1, regardless of the setting
of this flag.

the command TEST-INIT.

The default setting is a sample list of two standard TPS exercises, both 
to be run in mode ML (also standard in TPS). If you set this flag yourself,
beware of unexported symbols --- which is to say, make sure that the 
symbols you use are all in the USER package (this is particularly 
necessary if you are using library theorems which are not yet loaded
into TPS, or they may end up interned in the wrong package). If in doubt,
put "USER::" before all symbols, thus:

(setq test-theorems '((cl-user::thm30 . cl-user::mode-thm30) (cl-user::x2112 . cl-user::ml)))

You can use the flag TEST-MODIFY to alter modes on the fly as TPS-TEST runs.
See the help messages for TEST-INIT and TEST-MODIFY for more information.
It takes values of type SYMBOLPAIRLIST and belongs to subjects \texttt{MAINTAIN}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
((X2106   ML) (X2108   ML))
\end{lstlisting}

The total number of projection substitutions 
allowed for any given variable. See also MAX-SUBSTS-VAR
and MAX-SUBSTS-PROJ-TOTAL.
This applies to higher-order unification (UN88 or UN90) only.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-INTEGER and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
NIL
\end{lstlisting}

\item[MAX-SUBSTS-PROJ-TOTAL] \index{MAX-SUBSTS-PROJ-TOTAL@MAX-SUBSTS-PROJ-TOTAL, {\bf Flag}} 
The total number of projection substitutions 
allowed for any given dpairset. See also MAX-SUBSTS-VAR
and MAX-SUBSTS-PROJ.
This applies to higher-order unification (UN88 or UN90) only.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-INTEGER and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
NIL
\end{lstlisting}

\item[MAX-SUBSTS-QUICK] \index{MAX-SUBSTS-QUICK@MAX-SUBSTS-QUICK, {\bf Flag}} 
When NIL, quick unification is governed by the MIN-QUICK-DEPTH
flag, and only minimal amounts of MAX-SUBSTS checking are done during 
quick unification.
When MIN-SUBSTS-QUICK is a positive integer, quick unification 
(i.e. partial unification of a possible connection) is considered as a 
special case of normal unification, with MAX-SUBSTS-VAR temporarily 
equal to the value of MAX-SUBSTS-QUICK.
When MIN-SUBSTS-QUICK is 0, quick unification goes down as far as it can 
until it is forced to either branch or violate MAX-SUBSTS-VAR. (This is 
almost equivalent to MAX-SUBSTS-QUICK NIL and MIN-QUICK-DEPTH 1.) 

Note: non-NIL values of MAX-SUBSTS-QUICK only take effect if MAX-SUBSTS-VAR
is also non-NIL. In this case, other flags will also be affected, as follows:
APPLY-MATCH will be ignored (the matching routine that is used will be a 
variant of APPLY-MATCH-ALL-FRDPAIRS)
COUNTSUBS-FIRST and STOP-AT-TSN will be T.
SUBSUMPTION-CHECK, UNIF-COUNTER and UNIF-TRIGGER will be NIL.
UNI-SEARCH-HEURISTIC will be BREADTH-FIRST.
MIN-QUICK-DEPTH and MAX-UTREE-DEPTH will be ignored.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-INTEGER and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{MS98-1}, \texttt{IMPORTANT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
NIL
\end{lstlisting}

\item[MAX-SUBSTS-VAR] \index{MAX-SUBSTS-VAR@MAX-SUBSTS-VAR, {\bf Flag}} 
The maximum number of substitutions allowed for any given
free variable in a dpairset. This is cumulative (i.e. if an old 
variable f is replaced by h1, which is in turn replaced by h2,
that counts as two substitutions for f). Only projections or
imitations are counted; eliminating substitutions are not.
See also MAX-SUBSTS-PROJ and MAX-SUBSTS-PROJ-TOTAL.
This applies to higher-order unification (UN88 or UN90) only.
It takes values of type NULL-OR-INTEGER and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{MS98-1}, \texttt{IMPORTANT}, \texttt{UNIFICATION}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}
NIL
\end{lstlisting}

2
\end{lstlisting}

\item[PRIMSUB-VAR-SELECT] \index{PRIMSUB-VAR-SELECT@PRIMSUB-VAR-SELECT, {\bf Flag}} 
If T, primsubs will only be applied to those variables
which occur both negatively and positively as the head variable
of some leaves in the current eproof.
If NIL, primsubs will be applied to any variable which occurs
either negatively or positively or both, anywhere
It takes values of type BOOLEAN and belongs to subjects \texttt{TRANSMIT}, \texttt{PRIMSUBS}.  The default value is: \begin{lstlisting}

\section{Top Levels}

\begin{description} 
\item[COMMAND-LINE-SWITCHES] \index{COMMAND-LINE-SWITCHES} 
Several switches can be given on the command line when
TPS is started up. They are as follows:

-grader starts TPS in the GRADER top level.
-batch <file1> will execute the work file <filename>.work and 
               then quit TPS.
-service <name> <in> <out> will start a TPS with identifier <name>
               looking for requests from <in> and sending output to <out>.
               This gives a general way for external programs to ask
               TPS to prove a thm and receive the proof.
-lservice <portnum>
               Similar to -service, but assumes there is a listener
               on the machine at port <portnum>.  TPS connects to this
               and uses the socket to take requests and send output.
-server <tps-image-file> <etps-image-file> [-logdir <directory for log files>] [-port <portnum>]
               This starts TPS or ETPS as a web server.  Browsers
               can connect via http://<machine-name>:<portnum>
               where the default <portnum> is 29090 (but another can
               be explicitly given).  Once a browser connects to this
               TPS server, the client can start a new TPS or ETPS image
               (assuming the client has access rights, see SETUP-ONLINE-ACCESS).
               The server can also send html files to the client.
-remoteuser <userid> <portnum>
               This starts TPS or ETPS for a remote user.  This option
               is used when TPS or ETPS is started by a running TPS server.
               It should rarely (or never) be used when TPS is started directly.
               <portnum> is the port number of a passive socket waiting for a 
               connection.  Once TPS or ETPS starts for a remoteuser, it connects
               to this socket and sends it the port number of a new passive
               socket that the client can use to connect to this TPS or ETPS.
-javainterface <java command> [-other <java args>]
               This command line switch tells TPS to start a java
               interface from which it will receive input and to which
               it will send output.  The arguments after -javainterface
               and (possibly) before a -other switch indicate how to start
               the java interface.  For example, java TpsWin.
               This will be appended to the name of the machine and a port number
               (determined at runtime).
               If there is a -other switch, then the arguments after this will be 
               appended after the port number.
-omega will prevent -batch from quitting TPS
-outfile <file2.prf>, in the presence of -omega and -batch, runs the 
                  work file <filename1>.work and then remains in
                  TPS. When the user exits, <file2.prf> will be 
                  written, containing the current version of the 
                  dproof created by the work file. A file <file2.prt>
                  will also be written. Note that the given filename
                  filename MUST end with .prf
-outfile <file2>, in the presence of -batch alone, sends a script
                  of the entire session to <file2>.
-problem -mode -slist belong together; they will execute the given problem
                  using the given mode and searchlist.
              
Examples:

tps3 -- -batch thm266 
  runs thm266.work through tps3, showing the output on the terminal.
tps3 -- -batch thm266 -outfile thm266.script
  does the same but directs the output to thm266.script.
tps3 -- -omega -batch thm266 -outfile thm266.prf
  starts TPS, runs thm266.work and then enters the TPS command-line 
  interface. When the user exits, it writes the current proof into
  the file thm266.prf
tps3 -- -batch thm266 -outfile /dev/null
  does the same but discards the output.

Notice that the "--" is required for allegro lisp, but not for cmucl,
where the equivalent commands are of the form:   tps3cmu -batch thm266

\section{Printing}

\begin{description} 
\item[PRFW-PALL] \index{PRFW-PALL} 
An option for ETREE-NAT-VERBOSE.
After each tactic during ETREE-NAT, in the proofwindow "Complete Proof",
print the current proof.

\item[PRFW-\textasciicircum P] \index{PRFW-\textasciicircum P} 
An option for ETREE-NAT-VERBOSE.
After each tactic during ETREE-NAT, in the proofwindow "Current Subproof",
print the current plan-support pair in the proof.

\item[PRFW-\textasciicircum PN] \index{PRFW-\textasciicircum PN} 
An option for ETREE-NAT-VERBOSE.
After each tactic during ETREE-NAT, in the proofwindow "Current Subproof 
and Line Numbers", print the current plan-support pair in the proof, and
also print just the line numbers of the other lines in the proof.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Proof Outline}

\begin{description} 
\item[COMPRESS] \index{COMPRESS} 
A flag setting for TURNSTILE-INDENT-AUTO.
Similar to VARY, but also removes other spaces in the proof (e.g. around
dots, and between line numbers and hypotheses).

\item[FIX] \index{FIX} 
A flag setting for TURNSTILE-INDENT-AUTO.
When printing a proof, fixes the turnstiles in the column given by 
TURNSTILE-INDENT (so they'll all line up with one another).
Lines with large numbers of hypotheses will push the turnstile onto the
following line.

\item[MIN] \index{MIN} 
A flag setting for TURNSTILE-INDENT-AUTO.
When printing a proof, fixes the turnstiles as far to the left as possible
while still putting it in the same column on every line.
Lines with large numbers of hypotheses will push the column of turnstiles
far to the right of the page; if it moves too far to the right, then 
this flag will be treated as though it were set to FIX instead.

MIN is also a setting for a good many other flags, where it is mostly
self-explanatory.

\item[VARY] \index{VARY} 
A flag setting for TURNSTILE-INDENT-AUTO.
Print the turnstile one space after the hypotheses in each line, so 
the turnstiles will not all line up in one column in the final proof.

\item[SK1] \index{SK1} 
A setting for the flag SKOLEM-DEFAULT.
SK1 is the original method due to Skolem, where wffs of the form
EXISTS y . M are replaced by M(g(...)), and the Skolem constants
g take as arguments all the x such that FORALL x occurs in the wff 
and EXISTS y . M is in its scope.

A setting for the flag SKOLEM-DEFAULT.
SK3 is a variant of the original method due to Skolem, where wffs 
of the form EXISTS y . M are replaced by M(g(...)), and the Skolem 
constants g take as arguments all the free variables
of EXISTS y . M.  When SK3 is used to find an expansion proof,
the translation to a natural deduction proof may fail, since
the appropriately general rules of inference are not implemented
in TPS at present.

\begin{description} 
\item[D-HIGHEST] \index{D-HIGHEST} 
A setting for DEFAULT-OB.
The default next obligation in mtree is the highest element of the 
set of smallest obligations (i.e. given the set of all obligations with
the fewest possible literals, the first element of this set to be found
by breadth-first search).

\item[D-SMALLEST] \index{D-SMALLEST} 
A setting for DEFAULT-OB.
The default next obligation in mtree is the deepest element of the 
set of smallest obligations (i.e. given the set of all obligations with
the fewest possible literals, the first element of this set to be found
by depth-first search).

\item[DEEPEST] \index{DEEPEST} 
A setting for DEFAULT-OB.
The default next obligation in mtree is found by depth-first search
of the obligation tree.

\item[HI-LO] \index{HI-LO} 
A setting for DEFAULT-OB-MATE.
When applying ADD-CONN to an mtree, choose the default obligation by
finding the obligation which occurs lowest; this obligation was 
first added at some point in the matingstree. Then chooses the highest 
obligation which was added at the same point in the matingstree.

\item[HIGHEST] \index{HIGHEST} 
A setting for DEFAULT-OB.
The default next obligation in mtree is found by breadth-first search
of the obligation tree.

A setting for MT-DEFAULT-OB-MATE
When applying ADD-CONN to an mtree, choose the default obligation by
choosing the obligation which lies highest (i.e. nearest to the
root, but not the root itself).

\item[LOWEST] \index{LOWEST}

When applying ADD-CONN to an mtree, choose the default obligation by
choosing the obligation which lies lowest (i.e. furthest from the
root).

Given a list of tags for connections, multiply them together to get
a tag for the mating.

\item[SAME-CONNS] \index{SAME-CONNS} 
A setting for MT-SUBSUMPTION-CHECK.
Will check whether the mtree node about to be added is
duplicated elsewhere in the tree, and will reject it if it is. (This will use
the SAME-TAG function, and then do a more thorough check if the 
tags match.)

\item[SAME-TAG] \index{SAME-TAG} 
A setting for MT-SUBSUMPTION-CHECK.
Will check whether the tag of the mtree node about to be added (an integer 
generated from the list of connections) is the same as any other existing tag, 
and will reject it if it is. See TAG-CONN-FN and TAG-LIST-FN. (Note that most 
tag functions can produce the same tag for different matings, so this may 
reject connections unnecessarily.)

\item[SUBSET-CONNS] \index{SUBSET-CONNS} 
A setting for MT-SUBSUMPTION-CHECK.
Will check whether the connections at the mtree node about to be
added are a subset of those at some other node. (This is only really useful in
MT94-11, where all possible new nodes are added, breadth-first, to the tree.
It is probably too restrictive for the other mtree searches.)

\item[TAG-CONN-LEAFNO] \index{TAG-CONN-LEAFNO} 
A setting for TAG-CONN-FN.
Given a connection, return the product of the integer parts of the two leaf names
in the given connection.

\item[TAG-CONN-QUICK] \index{TAG-CONN-QUICK} 
A setting for TAG-CONN-FN.
Given a connection, return TPS's internal number for the connection. (Actually,
it uses (1 + this number), so as to avoid multiplying by one.)

Use a path-focused procedure (MS90-3, MS90-9 or MS91-7)

\item[QUERY-JFORMS] \index{QUERY-JFORMS} 
A flag setting for QUERY-USER.
The mating search process will stop after printing each 
vpform and ask whether to search on this vpform or to generate another.
(Note: in MS90-3, this is pointless, since the vpform never changes.)

\item[QUERY-SLISTS] \index{QUERY-SLISTS} 
A flag setting for QUERY-USER.
In the TEST top level, stops after each setting of the
flags and asks whether to search with those settings.

\item[SHOW-JFORMS] \index{SHOW-JFORMS} 
A flag setting for QUERY-USER.
Like QUERY-JFORMS, but automatically answers no to each 
question (and hence never actually proceeds with a search).

different option sets have been tried.

\item[ADD-OPTIONS-ORIGINAL] \index{ADD-OPTIONS-ORIGINAL}

bracket for a new option set exceeds OPTIONS-GENERATE-ARG.

\item[ALL-PENALTIES-FN] \index{ALL-PENALTIES-FN} 
A setting for WEIGHT-B-FN.
Much the same as SIMPLE-WEIGHT-B-FN but also adds a penalty for 
extra duplications given by the PENALTY-FOR-ORDINARY-DUP flag.

\item[DOUBLE-ARG] \index{DOUBLE-ARG} 
A flag setting for OPTIONS-GENERATE-UPDATE.
Each time options are updated, double the value of 
OPTIONS-GENERATE-ARG.

\item[DOUBLE-WEIGHT] \index{DOUBLE-WEIGHT} 
A flag setting for RECONSIDER-FN.
When an option set runs out of time, double its weight.

\item[EXPANSION-LEVEL-WEIGHT-A] \index{EXPANSION-LEVEL-WEIGHT-A} 
A setting for the flag WEIGHT-A-FN.
Returns the expansion level of the option to be used as a weight.
The expansion level is (roughly) the number of times that NAME-PRIM
had to be called in order to generate this option -- usually 1.

\item[IDENT-ARG] \index{IDENT-ARG} 
A flag setting for OPTIONS-GENERATE-UPDATE.
Each time options are updated, leave the value of 
OPTIONS-GENERATE-ARG unchanged.

\item[INCREMENT-WEIGHT] \index{INCREMENT-WEIGHT}

A flag setting for WEIGHT-C-FN.
Returns the number of leaves in the relevant etree.

\item[OPTION-SET-NUM-VPATHS] \index{OPTION-SET-NUM-VPATHS} 
A flag setting for WEIGHT-C-FN.
Returns the number of vertical paths through the relevant etree.

\item[SIMPLE-WEIGHT-B-FN] \index{SIMPLE-WEIGHT-B-FN} 
A setting for WEIGHT-B-FN.
Returns the sum of the penalties for the primsubs, multiple subs 
and duplications used in the option set (see the flags

\item[SIMPLEST-WEIGHT-B-FN] \index{SIMPLEST-WEIGHT-B-FN} 
A setting for WEIGHT-B-FN.
Returns 1 for the original option set and adds 
1 for each primsub or duplication (the idea is to set the coefficients of 
weight-a and weight-c to zero while using SIMPLEST-WEIGHT-B-FN).

A flag setting for OPTIONS-GENERATE-UPDATE.
Each time options are updated, square the value of

\section{Extensional Search}

\begin{description} 
\item[MS03-7] \index{MS03-7} 
A setting for DEFAULT-MS, DEFAULT-MATE and DEFAULT-EXPAND.
This uses the MS03-7 mating search procedure which incorporates 
extensionality reasoning, equality reasoning, and set variable reasoning 
as described in Chad E. Brown's thesis.

The search procedures MS03-7 and MS04-2 are similar in that they are
both extensional search procedures.  MS03-7 does a saturation style
search (with no backtracking).

MS04-2 is proven complete in Chad E. Brown's thesis.  MS03-7 is
probably complete, but this has not been proven.

See Also: MS04-2.

\item[MS04-2] \index{MS04-2} 
A setting for DEFAULT-MS, DEFAULT-MATE and DEFAULT-EXPAND.
This uses the MS04-2 mating search procedure which incorporates 
extensionality reasoning, equality reasoning, and set variable reasoning 
as described in Chad E. Brown's thesis.

The search procedures MS03-7 and MS04-2 are similar in that they are
both extensional search procedures.  MS03-7 performs a kind of saturation search.
MS04-2 performs a depth-first search (with weights to control the order of choices)
with backtracking and a depth bound.  Iterative deepening is used to ensure
completeness.

MS04-2 is proven complete in Chad E. Brown's thesis.

See Also: MS03-7.

Always allow double negations to be used as imitation terms.

\item[APPLY-MATCH-ALL-FRDPAIRS] \index{APPLY-MATCH-ALL-FRDPAIRS} 
A setting for APPLY-MATCH.
In unification search, applies match to all flexible-rigid pairs 
and chooses whichever will have fewest substitutions.

\item[APPLY-MATCH-ALL-FRDPAIRS-MSV] \index{APPLY-MATCH-ALL-FRDPAIRS-MSV} 
A setting for APPLY-MATCH.
As for APPLY-MATCH-ALL-FRDPAIRS, but also checks for
MAX-SUBSTS-VAR violations at the same time. This is obsolete,
and is ignored by path-focused procedures.

\item[APPLY-MATCH-MAX-SUBSTS] \index{APPLY-MATCH-MAX-SUBSTS} 
A setting for APPLY-MATCH.
In unification search, applies match to whichever flexible-rigid
pair is closest to exceeding the bound in MAX-SUBSTS-VAR.
If it finds one with a unique substitution, it uses that.

\item[APPLY-MATCH-MIN-SUBSTS] \index{APPLY-MATCH-MIN-SUBSTS} 
A setting for APPLY-MATCH.
The opposite of APPLY-MATCH-MAX-SUBSTS: chooses the pair
which is farthest from the MAX-SUBSTS-VAR bound. This only
works for non-path-focused procedures, and should be deleted
someday because it's useless.

\item[APPLY-MATCH-MOST-CONSTS] \index{APPLY-MATCH-MOST-CONSTS} 
A setting for APPLY-MATCH.
In unification search, applies match to whichever flex-rigid
pair contains the most constant symbols. This only
works for non-path-focused procedures, and should be deleted
someday because it's useless.

\item[BEST-FIRST] \index{BEST-FIRST} 
A setting for UNI-SEARCH-HEURISTIC.
Search the unification tree best-first (take whichever leaf node
has the fewest free variables). BREADTH-FIRST is faster than this.

\item[BREADTH-FIRST] \index{BREADTH-FIRST} 
A setting for UNI-SEARCH-HEURISTIC.
Search the unification tree breadth-first.

\section{Searchlists}

\begin{description} 
\item[BREADTH-FIRST-SEARCH] \index{BREADTH-FIRST-SEARCH} 
A setting for TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN.
Tries all combinations of flags, but varies each flag a little at a time
rather than varying one flag through its entire range before trying the next.

\item[EXHAUSTIVE-SEARCH] \index{EXHAUSTIVE-SEARCH} 
A setting for TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN.
Tries all combinations of flags in a searchlist, 
varying one flag through its entire range before trying the next flag.

\item[PRESS-DOWN-2] \index{PRESS-DOWN-2} 
A setting for TEST-NEXT-SEARCH-FN.
This behaves like breadth-first search except that if varying
a flag makes the search faster, that flag is then prevented
from returning above its original value (the range of each flag is 
assumed to be ordered; if the range is (A B C D), and setting it to
C results in a faster search, it will never again be set to A or B).

A flag setting for REN-VAR-FN.
This is much like REN-VAR-X1, except it will avoid creating
two variables of the same name at different types (so it tends to 
produce higher exponents than REN-VAR-X1).

MIN-PRIM-LITS and MAX-PRIM-LITS literals. You can see these
subformulas by doing NAME-PRIM from the MATE top level. (Note:
both the instantiated and uninstantiated versions of each 
definition are used.)

A flag setting for PRIMSUB-METHOD.
Using the connectives AND and OR, and the quantifiers EXISTS and
FORALL (ranging over variables of types PRIM-BDTYPES), and also using
any abbreviations or equalities that occur in the gwff to be proven, 
primsubs are built up using the bounds given by MIN- and MAX-PRIM-LITS

are positive integers and M <= N.  As shortcuts, one may write M, which 
represents the range M--M;  M--, which stands for the range from line M 
through the last line of the current proof; and --N, which represents the 
range from the first line of the proof through line N.  Hence -- 
represents the range consisting of every line in the proof.

A list whose first element is one of NONE, EAGER, LAZY1 and DUAL,
and whose other (optional) elements are lists whose first element is
one of these four options and whose other elements are the names of 
definitions.
The first element is the default behaviour for rewriting definitions,
and the other lists are lists of exceptions to this default, with a
different behaviour specified.
NONE:  do not rewrite this definition at all.
EAGER: rewrite all of these definitions, in one big step, as soon 
       as possible.
LAZY1: rewrite these, one step at a time, when there are no more
       EAGER rewrites to do.
DUAL: as LAZY1, but rewrite these abbreviations A to a conjunction of
       A and A, and then deepen only one of these conjuncts. (e.g.
       TRANSITIVE p becomes 
       TRANSITIVE p AND FORALL x y z . [pxy AND pyz] IMPLIES pxz
LAZY2: synonym for DUAL.

For example: the value
(EAGER)
would be interpreted as "Rewrite every definition in one step."

(DUAL (EAGER TRANSITIVE) (NONE INJECTIVE SURJECTIVE))
would be interpreted as "Rewrite TRANSITIVE whenever it appears.
Don't ever rewrite INJECTIVE or SURJECTIVE. Rewrite every other 
definition in the DUAL way."

\begin{description} 
\item[REWRITE-DEFNS] \index{REWRITE-DEFNS} 
One of the following:
NONE: do not rewrite equalities
ONLY-EXT: rewrite only those equalities that can be rewritten using
          extensionality.
LEIBNIZ: rewrite all equalities using the Leibniz definition.
ALL: rewrite all equalities, using extensionality where possible
     and the Leibniz definition otherwise.
DUAL: As in the flag REWRITE-DEFNS.
PARITY1: Uses the parity to determine whether equalities should be
    rewritten as the setting LEIBNIZ or as the setting ALL.  For example,
    using PARITY1 when trying to prove the wff 
              A(OI) = B(OI) implies C
    the equality is expaned using Leibniz, and when trying to prove the wff
              D implies A(OI) = B(OI)
    the equality is expanded using extensionality.  The heuristic
    is that we often use the substitutivity property when we use an equation
    and use extensionality to show an equation.

\chapter{Utilities}
The internal name of this category is 
UTILITY.\\
An utility can be defined using DEFUTIL.
Allowable properties are: \texttt{FORM-TYPE}, \texttt{KEYWORDS}, \texttt{MHELP}.

\section{Top Levels}

\begin{description} 
\item[PROMPT-READ] \index{PROMPT-READ} 
PROMPT-READ is the canonical way of doing input in TPS.
It provides argument type checking, a default mechanism and options
which allow ? and ?? help and arbitrarily many other special responses.
Its form is

 (PROMPT-READ internal-var external-var
              initial-message-form argument-type default-value
              ((response form ...) (response form ...)))
 ~  

internal-var will hold the internal representation of the user's response
after the input.

external-var will hold the external representation of what the user typed.
If external-var = NIL, the external form of the input is thrown away.

initial-message-form is evaluated and should somehow output the initial
part of the prompt.

argument-type is the type of the object that the user is supposed to input.
Common here is 'YESNO

default-value is the internal representation of the default for the input.
A default-value of \$  means that there is no default.

((response form ...) (response form ...)) are forms to handle special responses
like ?, ?? or perhaps <Esc>.  response is either a single symbol or a list
of symbols and form ... are evaluated in case one of the corresponding
    responses has been typed.  A common use is
 ~  

 ((? (msgf "Please decide whether you want to see any more news."))
  (?? (mhelp 'yesno)))


 ~  Here is a complete example of a use of PROMPT-READ within an initialization
dialogue:
 ~  

  (let (ldefp)
    (prompt-read
      ldefp nil
      (msgf "Load private definitions? ")
      'yesno 'nil
      ((? (msgf "Load PPS:DEFS and PPS:MODES.INI ?"))
       (?? (mhelp 'yesno)))))
    
    (when ldefp (lload "pps:defs") (lload "pps:modes.ini")))

\item[QUERY] \index{QUERY} 
QUERY is the canonical way of obtaining a yes-no response
from the user. It calls PROMPT-READ with appropriate arguments. The only
difference between these two macros is that prompt-read sets a variable,
while query just returns T or nil. Its form is

       (query initial-message-form default-value)
 ~  

initial-message-form is evaluated and should somehow output the initial
part of the prompt.

default-value is the internal representation of the default for the input.
A default-value of \$  means that there is no default.

\item
\end{description}

\section{Review}

\begin{description} 
\item[IN-MODE] \index{IN-MODE} 
(IN-MODE mode form1 ... formn) is an extremely useful macro.
It will locally bind all flags and parameters affected by mode to the
value in the mode and the execute form1 ... formn.  Note that no initfn
is called when the flags are set.  Note also that the macro (of course!)
is expanded at compile-time and therefore changing the definition of
mode will have no effect on the execution of form1 ... formn until
the IN-MODE is recompiled or loaded in uncompiled form.  Examples
of uses are
 (IN-MODE SCRIBE-DOC (MSG (A . GWFF))) will print the gwff A in style
Scribe.
 (IN-MODE RE-READ (MSG (A . GWFF))) will print the gwff A in such a
way that it can be read back.

\item[PCALL] \index{PCALL} 
(PCALL operation arg1 ... argn)
is used inside functions whose output depends on the current value of
the STYLE parameter.  operation is typically something like PRINT-TYPESYM,
or BEGIN-ENVIRONMENT.  It expands in such a way that all the styles known
at compile-time are compiled in-line, but it will also work for styles
defined later, e.g. when another package is loaded.  arg1 ... argn are
handed to the function which is supposed to perform operation in the 
current style.  If an operation has not been defined for a particular
style, a THROWFAIL with an appropriate error message will be done.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Flags}

\begin{description} 
\item[ANALYZE-FLAG-DEPENDENCIES] \index{ANALYZE-FLAG-DEPENDENCIES} 
Analyze the functions defined in TPS lisp files
and print a list of search related flags and conditions under 
which they are relevant.

\item[UPDATE-FLAG] \index{UPDATE-FLAG} 
(UPDATE-FLAG flag)
is used to give the user a chance to change a flag or parameter.
The user will be prompted for a new value of flag, the default being
its current value.  This is useful in initialization dialogues.  For example:
(update-flag 'style)
will prompt the user for a style.  It the user simply types return, it will
be unchanged.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Collecting Help}

\begin{description} 
\item[PRINT-HTML] \index{PRINT-HTML} 
PRINT-HTML outputs help messages in HTML format, with links to the
other help messages in TPS. It takes three arguments:
  PRINT-HTML "arbitrary string" "/home/theorem/tps/doc/htmldoc/" ignore-tags
where the first argument is any string and the second argument is a prefix 
which should be a string containing the URL of the home directory of the 
TPS documentation. The third argument is optional, defaulting to NIL; 
if it's set to T, then PRINT-HTML will attempt to preserve existing HTML tags 
in the input string while still producing correct HTML output; if NIL, it won't 
try to do this. Output is produced on the screen, using the MSG command; it's 
up to the user to redirect it to a file (see the help messages for 
REROUTE-OUTPUT and REROUTE-OUTPUT-APPEND) or a string (using the lisp 
function (with-output-to-string (*standard-output*) <form>)).

For example:
PRINT-HTML "The flag NUM-OF-DUPS" "/users/foo"
 will return 
The flag <a href="/users/foo/num-of-dups.html">NUM-OF-DUPS</a>

The URL prefix should usually be the localised version given 
above, but if you're running this on a system outside CMU and you want to 
link to the documentation at CMU, use the prefix 
"http://gtps.math.cmu.edu/htmldoc/" instead.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Starting and Finishing}

\begin{description} 
\item[REROUTE-OUTPUT] \index{REROUTE-OUTPUT} 
REROUTE-OUTPUT is the canonical way of routing output of TPS
to a file exclusively.  (REROUTE-OUTPUT filename default form1 ... formn)
will open a file filename using default for figuring out parts of filename
which were not specified.  It then executes form1 ... formn such that
all output goes to filename.  Note that you can still send messages to the
terminal with COMPLAIN or TTYMSG, but MSG output will go to filename.
When the writing is completed, a message with the true filename will
be printed. If you want to suppress this message, set REROUTE-CLOSE-MESSAGE
to NIL.  Please think about the defaults, but if you want to use
the (most likely wrong) CLISP default, just use the global variable
*default-pathname-defaults*.

\item[REROUTE-OUTPUT-APPEND] \index{REROUTE-OUTPUT-APPEND} 
REROUTE-OUTPUT-APPEND is like REROUTE-OUTPUT, but appends to the end
of the file rather than superseding it, if it already exists.

\item[STRINGDT] \index{STRINGDT} 
(STRINGDT) prints out the date and time to the current output stream
(usually the terminal), and then returns NIL. (STRINGDT stream) directs
the output to some other stream, and (STRINGDT nil) prints nothing and 
returns a string containing the date and time.

\item[STRINGDTL] \index{STRINGDTL} 
(STRINGDTL) prints out a newline followed by the date and time to 
the current output stream (usually the terminal), and then returns NIL. 
(STRINGDTL stream) directs the output to some other stream, and 
(STRINGDTL nil) prints nothing and returns a string containing a newline 
followed by the date and time.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Predicates on Wffs}

\begin{description} 
\item[DEFWFFTEST] \index{DEFWFFTEST} 
DEFWFFTEST expands to a DEFWFFOP, where certain attributes are
given defaults.  Its intended use is for predicates on wffs.
(DEFWFFTEST tps-object \& rest props)
 will set RESULTTYPE to BOOLEAN, ARGTYPES to (GWFF-ILL) and ARGNAMES to
(GWFF).  Additional properties may be defined and defaults overridden
through props.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Wff Types}

\begin{description} 
\item[PRTWFF] \index{PRTWFF} 
(PRTWFF gwff (flag1 value1) ... (flagn valuen))  is the one of
the two canonical ways of printing wffs in TPS.  It will bind flag1 to
value1 etc. and then print gwff.  This is useful to write commands or
functions which print gwff in a particular style.  For example
(PRTWFF A (USE-DOTS NIL) (PRINTDEPTH 0))
will print the wff A without using dots and showing all levels.
The other way of printing wffs with MSG is (MSG (A. GWFF)).
If a certain combination of flag settings is used more than once,
consider using (DEFMODE USEFUL-MODE ...) and (IN-MODE USEFUL-MODE (PRTWFF A))
instead.
\item

\item[\% CATCH\% ] \index{\% CATCH\% } 
This is the old UCI-Lisp CATCH.
See the UCI-Lisp Manual for documentation.

\item[\% THROW\% ] \index{\% THROW\% } 
This is the old UCI-Lisp THROW.
See the UCI-Lisp Manual for documentation.

\item[COMPLAIN] \index{COMPLAIN} 
COMPLAIN is the canonical way of announcing an error by the user.
(COMPLAIN msg1 ... msgn) will ring a bell at the terminal, and then call
(MSG msg1 ... msgn) after making sure that the messages go to the terminal 
only. 

\item[COPY] \index{COPY} 
(COPY sexpr) will recursively copy the whole sexpr.  For something
less dramatic see also COPY-LIST.

\item[DEFCONSTYPE] \index{DEFCONSTYPE} 
Like DEFLISTTYPE, but for cons-cells rather than lists. 

\item[DEFLISTTYPE] \index{DEFLISTTYPE} 
DEFLISTTYPE is a macro that expands into a deftype\% .

 ~  (DEFLISTTYPE list-type single-type rest-props) defines the type of
lists with elements of type single-type.  rest-props can be used to
override any inherited attributes from the single-type, typically
used for the MHELP property.

 ~  In an alternative form, one can write (DEFLISTTYPE list-type
single-type (OTHER-KEYS (test form ...) (test form ...) ...) rest-props)
where form ... is executed if the corresponding test is non-NIL.
The variable list-type will hold the typed expression.  If none of
the tests is true, the usual will be done.

\item[FOR-EACH] \index{FOR-EACH} 
(FOR-EACH mapfn varlist list1 ... listn form1 ...)
is an iteration macro which applied mapfn (if omitted MAP) to
list1 ... listn, binding in turn each variable in varlist, then
executing form1 ...  It is roughly equivalent to
(mapfn \# '(lambda varlist form1 ...) list1 ... listn)

\item[MSG] \index{MSG} 
MSG is the canonical way of producing text output, error or warning
messages etc.  It has the general form (MSG item1 ... itemn) where each item
can be one of the following forms:
T -> (TERPRI)
F -> (FRESH-LINE) ((TERPRI), but only of not at beginning of line)
THROW -> print (again using MSG) value of most recent THROW, usually THROWFAIL
(T n) -> (TAB n)
(TX n) -> (TABX n) (tabs without using <tab> characters)
(E form) -> evaluates form without printing the result
(L list) -> (PRINLC list) (print list without outermost parens)
(form . argtype) -> calls the printfn for argtype on form.  This is extremely
                    useful for wffs, lines, type symbols etc.
n, n>0 -> (SPACES n)
n, n<0 -> -n times (TERPRI)
otherwise -> (PRINC otherwise)

\item[MSGF] \index{MSGF} 
(MSGF ...) expands to (MSG F ...).  It does a (FRESH-LINE) and then
calls MSG on the arguments.

\item[SET-OF] \index{SET-OF} 
(SET-OF var list form1 ... formn)
will take list and build a new list, in which every element which does not
satisfy form1 ... formn will be deleted.  E. g.
(SET-OF X '(0 1 -1 2 1 -2) (> X 0)) -> (0 1 2 1)

\item[THROWFAIL] \index{THROWFAIL} 
THROWFAIL is the canonical way of signalling errors in TPS.
The format is (THROWFAIL msg1 ... msgn) where msg1 ... msgn are
instructions for MSG.  See there.

\item[TPS-WARNING] \index{TPS-WARNING} 
WARNING is the canonical way of warning the user.
(WARNING msg1 ... msgn) will call (MSG T "Warning:  " msg1 ... msgn) after
making sure that the messages go to the terminal only.

\item[TTYMSG] \index{TTYMSG} 
(TTYMSG msg1 ... msgn) will call (MSG msg1 ... msgn) after
making sure that the messages go to the terminal only.

variables, skolem terms, selection terms, and rewrite justifications. For
all other nodes, show the shallow formula at that node.

\end{description}

\section{Weak Labels}

\begin{description} 
\item[CREATE-WEAK] \index{CREATE-WEAK}

\section{Saving Wffs}

\begin{description} 
\item[SV-WFF] \index{SV-WFF} 
Save a wff by appending it to the file SAVEDWFFS. The 
weak label name should not already exist (if it does, remove it
using RW). The wffs that are saved to this file can be reloaded
using the command QLOAD "savedwffs.lisp".
  This command dates from before the LIBRARY top level was 
introduced; you should probably avoid it. If you want to save 
a gwff, use CW to create a weak label, then go into the library
with LIB and use INSERT to save the wff.
\item
\end{description}

This is exactly the same function as name-primsubsts, but applies
to etrees rather than gwffs.

\item[PRIM-SINGLE] \index{PRIM-SINGLE}

the etree and creates a new jform, and is basically equivalent to
SUB-ETREE followed by DP* and CJFORM. The variable must be specified
in full detail, with both superscript and type, as in the vpform 
(e.g. "r\textasciicircum 1(ob(ob))").

\item[RESTORE-ETREE] \index{RESTORE-ETREE}

<Mate6>SAVE-ETREE
SAVEFILE (FILESPEC): File in which to save the etree ["x2106.etr"]>

<0>MATE x2108 (or MATE whatever)
<Mate1>RESTORE-ETREE
LOADFILE (FILESPEC): File in which to load the etree ["x2108.etr"]>"x2106.etr"

This currently only works for etrees generated with SKOLEM-DEFAULT nil.

Example of how to use SAVE-ETREE for X2106 and later use RESTORE-ETREE:

<Mate4>GO
<Mate5>MERGE-TREE
<Mate6>SAVE-ETREE
SAVEFILE (FILESPEC): File in which to save the etree ["x2106.etr"]>
Later come back into TPS and do the following:
<0>MATE x2108 (or MATE whatever)
<Mate1>RESTORE-ETREE
LOADFILE (FILESPEC): File in which to load the etree ["x2108.etr"]>"x2106.etr"
<Mate2>GO
<Mate3>LEAVE
Merge the expansion tree? [Yes]>Y
Now ETREE-NAT should work.

\section{Top Levels}

\begin{description} 
\item[ASSERT-TOP] \index{ASSERT-TOP} 
Leave the REWRITING top-level, inserting the obtained relation as a
lemma into the current natural deduction proof.

\item[BEGIN-PRFW] \index{BEGIN-PRFW} 
Begin proofwindow top level.
Open Current Subproof, Current Subproof \&  Line Numbers, and Complete Proof
windows with text size determined by the value of the flag CHARSIZE.
Printing in various windows can be modified by changing the flags
PROOFW-ALL, BLANK-LINES-INSERTED and PRINTLINEFLAG.
The initial size of the windows can be modified with the flags
PROOFW-ALL-HEIGHT and PROOFW-ALL-WIDTH; after the windows are open, they can
simply be resized as normal. PSTATUS will update the proofwindows manually
if necessary. 
Close the proofwindows with END-PRFW.

\item[DERIVE-IN] \index{DERIVE-IN} 
Start a derivation by rewriting using a particular theory.

\item[DONE] \index{DONE} 
Check whether the current derivation is complete. For rewriting
proofs, DONE checks whether the target line was obtained from the initial
line. In case of derivations without a target line, DONE prompts for a
line which is to be regarded as the target.

\item[PROOFLIST] \index{PROOFLIST} 
Print a list of all rewrite derivations currently in memory.
For proofs, the corresponding proof assertions are printed. For general
derivations, the corresponding initial lines are printed.

\item[PROVE] \index{PROVE} 
Prove a relation by rewriting.

\item[PROVE-IN] \index{PROVE-IN} 
Prove a relation by rewriting using a particular theory.

\item[RECONSIDER] \index{RECONSIDER}

For more details, use the PROOFLIST command.

\item[RESTOREPROOF] \index{RESTOREPROOF} 
Reads a rewriting proof from a file created by SAVEPROOF
and makes it the current proof.  A security feature prevents the 
restoration of saved proofs which have been altered in any way.
Retrieve any definitions which are used in the proof and stored in the
library before restoring the proof. If you don't specify a directory,
it will first try your home directory and then all the directories 
listed in SOURCE-PATH.

\item[SAVEPROOF] \index{SAVEPROOF} 
Saves the current rewriting proof to the specified file in
a form in which it can be restored.  Use RESTOREPROOF to restore the proof.
Overwrites the file if it already exists.
\item
\end{description}

\section{Printing}

\begin{description} 
\item[PALL] \index{PALL} 
Print all the lines in the current derivation.

\item[TEXPROOF] \index{TEXPROOF} 
Print the current proof into a tex file.
After leaving tps, run this .tex file through tex and print the resulting
file.

Many flags affect the output of texproof.
See: USE-INTERNAL-PRINT-MODE, TURNSTILE-INDENT-AUTO, TURNSTILE-INDENT,
LATEX-EMULATION, TEX-MIMIC-SCRIBE, PPWFFLAG, DISPLAYWFF, INFIX-NOTATION,

\section{Applying Rules}

\begin{description} 
\item[ANY] \index{ANY} 
Try to apply any active rewrite rule from the current theory and all
its subtheories. If there is no current theory, all active rewrite rules
will be tried.

\item[ANY*] \index{ANY*} 
Justify a line by a sequence of applications of any active
rewrite rules from the current theory in the forward direction, starting
from a preceding line. In most cases, this command will apply rewrite
rules in the forward direction as often as possible or until a specified
target wff is obtained. If the wff after rewriting is specified but the
one before rewriting is set to NIL, rewrite rules will be applied in the
backward direction, starting from the target formula.
CAUTION: may not terminate if APP*-REWRITE-DEPTH is set to NIL.

\item[ANY*-IN] \index{ANY*-IN} 
Justify a line by a sequence of applications of any active
rewrite rules from the specified subtheory of the current theory in the
forward direction, starting from a preceding line. In most cases, this
command will apply rewrite rules in the forward direction as often as
possible or until a specified target wff is obtained. If the wff after
rewriting is specified but the one before rewriting is set to NIL,
rewrite rules will be applied in the backward direction, starting from
the target formula.
CAUTION: may not terminate if APP*-REWRITE-DEPTH is set to NIL.

\item[APP] \index{APP} 
Apply a rewrite rule.

\item[APP*] \index{APP*} 
Justify a line by a sequence of applications of a rewrite rule in
the forward direction, starting from a preceding line. In most cases, this
command will apply a rewrite rule in the forward direction as often as
possible or until a specified target wff is obtained. If the wff after
rewriting is specified but the one before rewriting is set to NIL, the rewrite
rule will be applied in the backward direction, starting from the target
formula. CAUTION: may not terminate if APP*-REWRITE-DEPTH is set to NIL.

\item[AUTO] \index{AUTO} 
Search for a rewrite sequence between two lines using any active
rewrite rules from the current theory. The exact behaviour is affected by
following flags: REWRITING-AUTO-DEPTH, REWRITING-AUTO-TABLE-SIZE,
REWRITING-AUTO-MAX-WFF-SIZE, REWRITING-AUTO-SUBSTS

\item[SAME] \index{SAME} 
Use reflexivity of equality. The wffs A and B need to be identical
up to alphabetic change of bound variables.

\item[UNANY*] \index{UNANY*} 
Justify a line by a sequence of applications of any active
rewrite rules from the current theory in the backward direction, starting
from a preceding line. In most cases, this command will apply rewrite
rules in the backward direction as often as possible or until a specified
target wff is obtained. If the wff after rewriting is specified but the
one before rewriting is set to NIL, rewrite rules will be applied in the
forward direction, starting from the target formula.
CAUTION: may not terminate if APP*-REWRITE-DEPTH is set to NIL.

\item[UNANY*-IN] \index{UNANY*-IN} 
Justify a line by a sequence of applications of any active
rewrite rules from the specified subtheory of the current theory in the
backward direction, starting from a preceding line. In most cases, this
command will apply rewrite rules in the backward direction as often as
possible or until a specified target wff is obtained. If the wff after
rewriting is specified but the one before rewriting is set to NIL,
rewrite rules will be applied in the forward direction, starting from
the target formula.
CAUTION: may not terminate if APP*-REWRITE-DEPTH is set to NIL.

\item[UNAPP*] \index{UNAPP*} 
Justify a line by a sequence of applications of a rewrite rule in
the backward direction, starting from a preceding line. In most cases, this
command will apply a rewrite rule in the backward direction as often as
possible or until a specified target wff is obtained. If the wff after
rewriting is specified but the one before rewriting is set to NIL, the rewrite
rule will be applied in the forward direction, starting from the target
formula. CAUTION: may not terminate if APP*-REWRITE-DEPTH is set to NIL.

\section{Rearranging the Derivation}

\begin{description} 
\item[CLEANUP] \index{CLEANUP} 
Deletes unnecessary lines from a derivation.

\item[CONNECT] \index{CONNECT}

derivation appropriately. With symmetric relations, the command will also
rearrange the lines from which the higher-numbered line was obtained to
follow from the lower-numbered line.

\item[DELETE] \index{DELETE} 
      Delete lines from the proof outline.

\item[INTRODUCE-GAP] \index{INTRODUCE-GAP}

\section{Vpforms}

\begin{description} 
\item[COMMON] \index{COMMON} 
COMMON is the same as NIL. If the flag ORDER-COMPONENTS is set to COMMON
then the jform of the current eproof will not be modified by the mating search.

\item[NIL] \index{NIL} 
NIL is the same as COMMON. If the flag ORDER-COMPONENTS is set to NIL
then the jform of the current eproof will not be modified by the mating search.

\item[PATHNUM] \index{PATHNUM} 
PATHNUM is the same as T. If the flag ORDER-COMPONENTS is set to PATHNUM
then the components of a jform node will be rearranged in order of the number 
of paths which lie below them (go through them). In ms90-*, this will sort the 
top-level conjuncts into decreasing order (based on the number of paths through 
them).

\item[PATHNUM-REVERSED] \index{PATHNUM-REVERSED} 
PATHNUM-REVERSED is the same as T-REVERSED. If the flag 
ORDER-COMPONENTS is set to T-REVERSED then the components of a jform node will 
be rearranged in reverse order of the number of paths which lie below them 
(go through them).

\item[PREFER-RIGID1] \index{PREFER-RIGID1} 
If the flag ORDER-COMPONENTS is set to PREFER-RIGID1, then 
the order of the components in the jform of the current eproof will be sorted 
in terms of the number of rigid literals in a jform before beginning the 
mating search.

\item[PREFER-RIGID2] \index{PREFER-RIGID2} 
If the flag ORDER-COMPONENTS is set to PREFER-RIGID2, then 
the order of the components in the jform of the current eproof will be sorted 
in terms of the number of rigid literals in a jform before beginning the 
mating search.

\item[PREFER-RIGID3] \index{PREFER-RIGID3} 
If the flag ORDER-COMPONENTS is set to PREFER-RIGID3, then 
the components in the jform of the current eproof will be sorted 
as for PREFER-RIGID2, but with preference given to literals that 
arise from DUAL rewriting.

\item[REVERSE] \index{REVERSE} 
If the flag ORDER-COMPONENTS is set to REVERSE, then 
the order of the components in the jform of the current eproof will
be reversed before beginning the mating search.

\item[T] \index{T} 
T is the same as PATHNUM. If the flag ORDER-COMPONENTS is set to T
then the components of a jform node will be rearranged in order of the number 
of paths which lie below them (go through them).

\item[T-REVERSED] \index{T-REVERSED} 
T-REVERSED is the same as PATHNUM-REVERSED. If the flag 
ORDER-COMPONENTS is set to T-REVERSED then the components of a jform node will 
be rearranged in reverse order of the number of paths which lie below them 
(go through them).

\section{Mating search}

\begin{description} 
\item[FOCUS-MATING] \index{FOCUS-MATING} 
Reset some flags when a particular mating is reached. 
The default mating is the mating that is current at the
time when this command is invoked (so the user can often enter the 
mate top level, construct the mating manually and then type 
FOCUS-MATING). Otherwise, the mating should be typed in the form
((LEAFa . LEAFb) (LEAFc . LEAFd) ...) The order in which the connections
are specified within the mating, and the order of the literals within each
connection, do not matter.

\item[FOCUS-MATING*] \index{FOCUS-MATING*} 
Reset some flags when a particular mating is reached. Differs
from FOCUS-MATING in that it returns the flags to their original 
settings afterwards. The default mating is the mating that 
is current at the time when this command is invoked (so the user 
can often enter the mate top level, construct the mating manually and 
then type FOCUS-MATING*). Otherwise, the mating should be typed in the form
((LEAFa . LEAFb) (LEAFc . LEAFd) ...). The order in which the connections
are specified within the mating, and the order of the literals within each
connection, do not matter.
The values used for the "original" flag settings will also
be those that are current at the time when this command is invoked.

\item[FOCUS-OSET] \index{FOCUS-OSET} 
Reset some flags when a particular option set is reached. 
The option set should be entered in the form "oset-n" where n is a
positive integer. See also FOCUS-OSET*.
This only works for the procedures MS91-6 and MS91-7.
There is a similar monitor function for MS89 and MS90-9, 
called FOCUS-OTREE.

\item[FOCUS-OSET*] \index{FOCUS-OSET*} 
Reset some flags when a particular option set is reached, 
and then set the flags back again when the option set changes again.
The option set should be entered in the form "oset-n" where n is a
positive integer.
The values for the flags to revert to are those which are current at 
the time you typed FOCUS-OSET*. See also FOCUS-OSET.
This only works for the procedures MS91-6 and MS91-7.
There is a similar monitor function for MS89 and MS90-9, 
called FOCUS-OTREE*.

\item[FOCUS-OTREE] \index{FOCUS-OTREE} 
Reset some flags when a particular option tree is reached. 
The option tree should be entered in the form "OPTn" where n is a
positive integer. This only works for the procedures MS89 and MS90-9.
See also FOCUS-OTREE*.
There is a similar monitor function for MS91-6 and MS91-7, 
called FOCUS-OSET.

\item[FOCUS-OTREE*] \index{FOCUS-OTREE*} 
Reset some flags when a particular option tree is reached, 
and then set the flags back again when the option tree changes again.
The option tree should be entered in the form "OPTn" where n is a
positive integer.
The values for the flags to revert to are those which are current at 
the time you typed FOCUS-OTREE*. See also FOCUS-OTREE.
This only works for the procedures MS89 and MS90-9.
There is a similar monitor function for MS91-6 and MS91-7, 
called FOCUS-OSET*.

\item[MONITOR-CHECK] \index{MONITOR-CHECK} 
Prints out the given string every time the monitor is called, 
followed by the place from which it was called.

\item[PUSH-MATING] \index{PUSH-MATING} 
Executes a PUSH (i.e. halts and starts a new top level) when a 
particular mating is reached. The default mating is the mating that is current 
at the time when this command is invoked (so the user can often enter the 
mate top level, construct the mating manually and then type 
PUSH-MATING). Otherwise, the mating should be typed in the form
((LEAFa . LEAFb) (LEAFc . LEAFd) ...) The order in which the connections
are specified within the mating, and the order of the literals within each
connection, do not matter.
When PUSH-MATING is invoked, typing POP will leave the new top level and
continue with the search.
