<p>  	Computers can be programmed to do certain kinds of reasoning,
and find proofs of certain theorems.  Symbolic logic is used as the
formal language in which such reasoning is expressed.  Automated
deduction has many potential applications, including checking proofs
in mathematical papers, verifying software and hardware, and providing
inference mechanisms for automated reasoning tools.  We can anticipate
the eventual formalization of virtually all mathematical, scientific,
and technical knowledge, and the development of automated information
systems which use automated reasoning to assist in developing,
refining, verifying, and applying this knowledge.

<p>  	We demonstrate how the automated theorem proving system TPS,
which has been developed at CMU over several decades, proves theorems
automatically. TPS first searches for an expansion proof of the
theorem to be proved. This expresses in a nonredundant way the
fundamental combinatorial structure underlying various proofs of the
theorem. TPS then transforms the expansion proof into a proof in
natural deduction style.

<p>  	One of the dreams of automated reasoning is to develop one
general reasoning tool which can solve a great variety of problems, as
opposed to developing lots of special-purpose programs to solve
different types of problems.  We show how to express in purely logical
terms and automatically solve a problem which involves transporting a
wolf, goat, and cabbage across a river with a boat in which only one
of these items can be carried at a time.

<p>  	An element x is a fixed point of a function f mapping a set to
itself if f(x) = x. A function g which applies such a function f
repeatedly is called an iterate of f. For example, if g(t) =
f(f(f(f(t)))) for all t, then g is an iterate of f. We show how TPS
proves automatically the theorem that if some iterate of a function f
has a unique fixed point, then f has a fixed point.
