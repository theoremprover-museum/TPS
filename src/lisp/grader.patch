;;NOTE: Put items of the form (qload "file.lisp")
;;rather than (qload "file") into GRADER patch files.
;;Otherwise, further changes to the changed files
;;cause qload to try to compile the new version
;;when non-EXPERTs start up GRADER; they have no write
;;access to the bin directory, so everything crashes

(qload "grades1.lisp")
(qload "grades2.lisp")
