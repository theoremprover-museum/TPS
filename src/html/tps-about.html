<H1>About TPS and ETPS</H1>  <p></p>

TPS and ETPS are, respectively, the Theorem Proving System and the 
Educational Theorem Proving System. The former is an
automated theorem-prover for first-order logic and type theory. 
The latter is a cut-down version of TPS intended for use by 
students; it contains only commands relevant to proving theorems
interactively. 
TPS and ETPS  run in <A HREF="lisp-links.html">Common Lisp</A>, and
can be used on any system where Common Lisp runs. TPS and ETPS
have been used extensively under Unix and Linux systems, and to some extent under
Windows.

<p></p>

Potential applications of automated theorem proving include hardware
and software verification, partial automation of various mathematical
activities, promoting development of formal theories in a wide variety
of disciplines, deductive information systems for these disciplines,
expert systems which can reason, and certain aspects of artificial intelligence.

<p></p>

TPS can be used to prove theorems of first- and higher-order logic
interactively, automatically, or in a mixture of these modes, though
in automatic mode it is quite primitive in certain respects, such as
in dealing with equality.  It has facilities for searching for
expansion proofs, translating these into natural deduction proofs,
constructing natural deduction proofs, translating natural deduction
proofs which do not contain cuts into expansion proofs, and solving
unification problems in higher-order logic. It has a formula editor
which facilitates constructing new formulas from others already known
to TPS, and a library facility for saving formulas, definitions, and
modes (groups of flag settings).

<p></p>

The interactive facilities of TPS for constructing natural deduction
proofs have been used under the name ETPS in <A HREF="courses.html">logic courses</A> 
at <A HREF="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie
Mellon</A> for a number of years. Students generally learn to use ETPS
fairly quickly just by reading the <A HREF="tps-etps.ps">manual</A> (which contains some
complete examples) and playing with the system.  The student using
ETPS issues commands to apply rules of inference in specified ways,
and the computer handles the details of writing the appropriate lines
of the proof and checking that the rules can be used in this way. The
program thus allows students to concentrate on the essential logical
problems underlying the proofs, and it gives them immediate feedback
for both correct and incorrect actions.  ETPS permits students to work
forwards, backwards, or in a combination of these modes, and provides
facilities for rearranging proofs, deleting parts of proofs,
displaying only those parts of proofs under active consideration,
saving incomplete proofs, and printing proofs on paper.  The convenient
formula editor permits the student to extract needed formulas which
occur anywhere in the proof, and build new formulas from them. The
rules of inference and predefined problems in ETPS are mostly taken
from the textbook: <A HREF="andrews.html">Peter B. Andrews</A>, 
<b><A HREF="tttp.html">An Introduction to Mathematical Logic and Type Theory: To Truth Through Proof</A></b>,
Second Edition,  <A HREF="http://www.wkap.nl">Kluwer Academic Publishers</A>, 2002.
Descriptions of the rules of inference are
available online. When the teacher permits it, the student can obtain
hints from ETPS concerning what to try in various situations.
Students can send remarks or questions to the teacher without leaving
the program. A record of completed exercises is maintained by ETPS,
and can be processed by the GRADER program which is also part of TPS,
and which can be used to maintain and process numerical or letter
grades for any course.

TPS won the first competition between
higher-order theorem proving systems which has ever been held. The
competition, in the newly established THF demonstration division, was part of 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/CASC/22/">The CADE-22 ATP System Competition (CASC-22)</A> at
<A HREF="http://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca/cade22/">The 22nd International Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE-22)</A>
 in Montreal, Canada, during August, 2009.
